      <title>Update on iCloud&#43; Custom Email Domain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my custom domain with iCloud email for a couple weeks. Truth be
told I hardly notice any difference from when I used Gmail. That&amp;rsquo;s largely due
to using Apple Mail app as my primary interface. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any reliability
issues and the only real difference I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is the email size limit is
20MB as opposed to Gmail&amp;rsquo;s 25MB. The primary benefit I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is that
calendar invites end up on my iCloud calendar, which is where I prefer them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Migrating My Email From Google Workspace To iCloud&#43;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of migrating my email from Google Workspace to iCloud+. I&amp;rsquo;ve
been using Google Workspace (aka gsuite, aka whatever name Google switches to
next week) for my email for a long time. For ages it was free and made perfect
sense as a service. Those free accounts have gone away, and the service&amp;rsquo;s focus
is clearly aimed at the enterprise and not individuals like me. The price per
user is also about to increase on me, so this felt like a good time to try
something else. I&amp;rsquo;m only really interested in hosting email for a few custom
domains and have no needs for any features beyond that. Our family already uses
iCloud for everything so I figured why not give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
