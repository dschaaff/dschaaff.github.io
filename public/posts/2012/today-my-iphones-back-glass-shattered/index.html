Squaretrade sent me a refurbished replacement for my defective iPhone 4 a few
months back.  I was positive that their replacement used 3rd party glass for the
front and the back.  There was no oleophobic coating and fingerprints were
extremely difficult to wipe off.  Something also felt different about the glass.
I put an oleophobic screen
protector
on the font.  It scratches a  lot more easily than the glass but it also only
takes a swipe of the shirt to clean.  There was no such solution for the back.

replacement part used by Squaretrade.">
