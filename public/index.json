I thought I\u0026rsquo;d highlight how you can use a similar workflow in Atlassian\u0026rsquo;s Bamboo application. This assumes you already have a working Bamboo setup and are familiar with the general process for testing Puppet modules with rspec.\nCreate a new plan The first step is to set up a new plan to use for the testing. Click \u0026ldquo;Create\u0026rdquo; and then \u0026ldquo;Create a new plan\u0026rdquo; in the top menu bar.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_08_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_08_pm.png)\nBamboo organizes related jobs, builds, etc. into projects. On the next screen either create a new Puppet project or select an existing project if you\u0026rsquo;ve already set that up.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_10_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_10_pm.png)\nFill in the details and select the repository you\u0026rsquo;d like to start testing. Bamboo can read from a large number of version control systems. I happen to use Bitbucket so this is simple. Once your happy with the selections click \u0026ldquo;Configure plan\u0026rdquo;.\n![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_15_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_15_pm.png)\nAt the next screen we setup our tasks. The first task, Source Code Checkout, is added by default and checks out the repo configured in the previous step. I like to break things down into small script tasks so they are easier to troubleshoot and duplicate between jobs.\nClick add task and select script.\n![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_17_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_17_pm.png)\nThe first step is to setup the Ruby environment. This presumes you already have Bamboo build agents up and running and that rvm is installed. This script below is what I use. It performs some checks to ensure ruby is properly setup.\n#!/bin/bash if [ \u0026#34;$(ps -p \u0026#34;$$\u0026#34; -o comm=)\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34; ]; then /bin/bash \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; exit \u0026#34;$?\u0026#34; fi source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh ruby=\u0026#34;ruby-2.1.8\u0026#34; install_count=`rvm list | grep $ruby | wc -l` if [ $install_count -lt 1 ]; then rvm install $ruby fi rvm use $ruby rvm user gemsets Now click \u0026ldquo;Add task\u0026rdquo; and add another script task. We will use this script step to create a new gemset and install the gems listed in the Gemfile using bundler. If you use environment variables to specify the version of puppet to install enter that in the environment variables field.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_55_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_55_pm.png)\n#!/bin/bash if [ \u0026#34;$(ps -p \u0026#34;$$\u0026#34; -o comm=)\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34; ]; then /bin/bash \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; exit \u0026#34;$?\u0026#34; fi source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh ruby=\u0026#34;ruby-2.1.8\u0026#34; gemset=\u0026#34;puppet-4.8.0-validate\u0026#34; rvm use $ruby rvm user gemsets rvm gemset create $gemset rvm gemset use $gemset gem install bundler rm Gemfile.lock bundle install Now lets add another script step and use it to run the actual tests. At the end of the test this removes the Gemset to ensure a clean environment for each new run. You can also add other options here using environment variables such as STRICT_VARIABLES=no.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_30_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_30_pm.png)\n#!/bin/bash if [ \u0026#34;$(ps -p \u0026#34;$$\u0026#34; -o comm=)\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34; ]; then /bin/bash \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; exit \u0026#34;$?\u0026#34; fi source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh ruby=\u0026#34;ruby-2.1.8\u0026#34; gemset=\u0026#34;puppet-4.8.0-validate\u0026#34; rvm use $ruby rvm user gemsets rvm gemset use $gemset bundle exec rake validate bundle exec rake spec rvm gemset delete --force $gemset We\u0026rsquo;ve now covered the basics needed to get started and can click create at the bottom to finalize the plan. After doing so we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at the job configuration page. The script tasks we just created are in the \u0026ldquo;Default Job\u0026rdquo;.\n![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_33_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_33_pm.png)That name isn\u0026rsquo;t very clear so lets update it. Click \u0026ldquo;Default Job\u0026rdquo; and then select the \u0026ldquo;Job details\u0026rdquo; tab. Here we\u0026rsquo;ll enter a more descriptive name such as \u0026ldquo;Puppet 4.8 rspec\u0026rdquo; and click save. A descriptive name is handy because you can clone stages across plans to avoid repeating the script setup.\nRepository Triggers If you\u0026rsquo;re using the built in Bitbucket Server integration like my setup then Bamboo will automatically run the plan whenever a new commit is pushed to the repo. You can customize the type of trigger to use polling, scheduling, or other options as well. Simply select the \u0026ldquo;Triggers\u0026rdquo; tab under plan configuration and set appropriately.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_37_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_37_pm.png)\nTracking Results If you were to run this plan now you would get a pass or fail in Bamboo but would have to look at the logs for the job to see the actual details of the results. We can use JUnit to get an better view of the test in Bamboo. To set this up create a .rspec file in the root of the Puppet module you\u0026rsquo;re testing with the following content\n--format RspecJunitFormatter --out results.xml This will write the results of the test in JUnit format to the results.xml file. You\u0026rsquo;ll also want to add this file to .gitignore. Now we can add a step to our plan to parse this file. Go back to the plan configuration and select the stage we setup previously. Click add task and select \u0026ldquo;JUnit Parser.\u0026rdquo;![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_41_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_41_pm.png)\nConfigure the JUnit parser so it finds our results file.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_42_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_42_pm.png)\nClick save and run the plan again. You\u0026rsquo;ll now see your test results nicely formatted in the plan history. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of what that looks like for failed tests.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_44_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_44_pm.png)![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_45_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_45_pm.png)\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to redo this work for each repo. When setting up a plan for a new module start by removing the default stage. Then click add job and select clone an existing job. ![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__4_01_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__4_01_pm.png)\nYou can then select which plan to clone from.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__4_02_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__4_02_pm.png)\nIt takes a bit more setup then using Travis CI but its not difficult to get rspec testing up and running in Bamboo.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2017/automated-puppet-tests-with-bamboo/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rnelson0?lang=en\"\u003ernelson0\u003c/a\u003e is walking through \u003ca href=\"https://rnelson0.com/2017/01/12/automating-puppet-tests-with-a-jenkins-job-version-1-0/\"\u003eautomated Puppet testing with Jenkins \u003c/a\u003eon his blog.

Overall I\u0026rsquo;d say the process was pretty painless. The gist of what I did\nstart running rspec tests against Puppet 4\nfix issues found in tests\nrun the catalog preview tool and fix any issues found\nturn on the future parser on the existing master\nturn off stringify facts\ncreate new master and PuppeDB server\nmigrate agents to new master\nThankfully our code wasn\u0026rsquo;t too difficult to update and most of the forge modules we use had also been updated.\nCreating the New Master I did not want to upgrade our existing master for a variety of reasons I won\u0026rsquo;t get into here. Instead I took the opportunity to migrate it from an old vm to running on ec2 with PuppetDB in RDS. I have to give props to the puppet team for greatly simplifying the setup process of a new master in Puppet 4. Setting up puppetserver is significantly easier then the old passenger based server.\nMigrating the Agents Puppet provides a module to migrate your agents to the new master. It will copy the existing ssl certs to the new directory and upgrade the agent. I was not able to do this since I was not migrating certs to the new master (I needed to add new DNS alt names). The consequence of this was needing to find a way to upgrade and migrate the agents in an automated fashion. I accomplished this entirely with puppet! The process was\npre-create /etc/puppetlabs/puppet\ndrop a new config into /etc/puppetlabs.puppet/puppet.conf with the new master name\nsetup the puppetlabs puppet collection repo\ninstall the new puppet-agent package\nupdate cron job for new puppet paths (the fact that I already ran puppet using cron made this simple)\npurge the old /etc/puppet directory\nA puppet run would take place on the old master and prep things using the steps above. Then when the cronjob kicked in it would run against the new master and get a new cert issued. Overall this worked really well and we only had to touch 2 machines by hand.\nMigrate Puppet Manifest This is the manifest I used to migrate our linux machines.

Somehow I had overlooked the removal of dynamic scoping in ERB templates. This piece of code was not covered by rspec tests, an area for improvement! I relied on this to configure logstash output to elasticsearch. Under Puppet 3 the relevant piece of ERB looked like this\noutput { if [type] == \u0026#34;syslog\u0026#34; { elasticsearch { hosts =\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;%= @es_input_nodes.collect { |node| \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; + node.to_s + \u0026#39;:\u0026#39; + @elasticsearch_port.to_s + \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; }.join(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;] ssl =\u0026gt; true } } The value of es_input_nodes was pulled from the params class\nclass elk::logstash ( $syslog_port = $elk::params::syslog_port, $elasticsearch_nodes = $elk::params::elasticsearch_nodes, $es_input_nodes = $elk::params::es_input_nodes, $elasticsearch_port = $elk::params::elasticsearch_port, $netflow_port = $elk::params::netflow_port ) The params class pulls the info from Puppet DB.\n$es_input_nodes = sort(query_nodes(\u0026#39;Class[Elk::elasticsearch] and elasticsearchrole=data or elasticsearchrole=client\u0026#39;)) The removal of dynamic scoping templates meant the template was putting empty values in the logstash config and breaking the service. To fix the variables needed to be scoped properly in the template and now look like this\noutput { if [type] == \u0026#34;syslog\u0026#34; { elasticsearch { hosts =\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;%= scope[\u0026#39;elk::logstash::es_input_nodes\u0026#39;].collect { |node| \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; + node.to_s + \u0026#39;:\u0026#39; + scope[\u0026#39;elk::logstash::elasticsearch_port\u0026#39;].to_s + \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; }.join(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;] ssl =\u0026gt; true } } Remaining Work Prior to the migration I relied on stephenrjohnson/pupptmodule to manage the puppet agent on Linux and macOS. Some work has been done on Puppet 4 compatability but there is still more to do. I\u0026rsquo;m close to updating the agent pieces for my needs but there is a lot of work to add puppet master support.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2016/finishing-the-puppet-4-migration/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTwo days ago I finished our migration to Puppet 4.

My first step was to query the nodes endpoint in puppetdb for all nodes and pipe it into a file.\ncurl http://puppetdb.example.com:8080/v3/nodes/ \u0026gt; nodesout.txt The output of this is json with an array of hashes.\n[{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;server2.example.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deactivated\u0026#34; : null, \u0026#34;catalog_timestamp\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;2016-11-28T19:28:14.828Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;facts_timestamp\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;2016-11-28T19:28:12.112Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;report_timestamp\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;2016-11-28T19:28:13.443Z\u0026#34; },{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;server.example.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deactivated\u0026#34; : null, \u0026#34;catalog_timestamp\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;2016-11-28T19:28:14.828Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;facts_timestamp\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;2016-11-28T19:28:12.112Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;report_timestamp\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;2016-11-28T19:28:13.443Z\u0026#34; }] I only want the name of each node so I need to parse that out.

I have found some big benefits to \u0026ldquo;chatops\u0026rdquo; however.\nVisibility Work that is done in the chatroom, or filtered into the chatroom, is visible to the whole team. This helps the team be aware of what others are doing and stay up to date. I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up on quite a few things from this that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have learned other wise. This is also why we choose to route a fair amount of notifications into chat. For example we have Jira connected to HipChat and it makes it really easy to stay on top of issues. We also push commit notifications, build notifications, etc in the chatroom. The downside to this is that the rooms get noisy and make it harder to follow actual conversations between humans. One strategy we use to combat that is creating multiple rooms and focusing them around a subject.\nLess Context Switching I have the ability to accomplish a task without context switching using bots even better then the visibility wins. We have HipChat open all day. It is far quicker to switch the focus to the HipChat window, slam in a command, and get back to what we were doing then it is to ssh into a server, run a command, and then log back out. My co-worker got inspired by Kevin Paulisse\u0026rsquo;s talk at puppet conf and their use of Hubot and led us to get our chatops on using the open source bot Lita. We\u0026rsquo;ve already done some work on our own plugins and I\u0026rsquo;m now sold on working this way.\nUsing Lita Working with Active Directory Our lita-activedirectory plugin allows us to leverage our cratus gem to query and interact with Active Directory over ldap. It currently supports checking if a user account is locked, and unlocking the user account. We plan to extend to allow querying for group memberships and other attributes. One less reason to open Active Directory Users and Computers!\nWorking with Puppet Our [lita-puppet[(https://github.com/knuedge/lita-puppet) plugin lets interact with our puppet infrastructure and puppetdb.

Here\u0026rsquo;s OpenVPN\u0026rsquo;s explanation\nBy increasing the MTU size of the tun adapter and by disabling OpenVPN's internal fragmentation routines the throughput can be increased quite dramatically. The reason behind this is that by feeding larger packets to the OpenSSL encryption and decryption routines the performance will go up.

During later testing we discovered that we could easily push 40mb/s over the OpenVPN tunnel into the ec2 instance, but only 1mb/s or less going the opposite direction. Obviously not ideal.\nSo how does ec2 MTU sizing play into this? We had on premise VMs on one side with a standard mtu of 1500 on their interfaces while the ec2 instance had jumbo frames enabled with an mtu of 9001. This meant that our traffic towards ec2 was being fragmented into an MTU of 1500 by linux on the on premise OpenVPN instance. Traffic out of ec2 towards the other end was not fragmented by the vpn instance at all and was sent along to the internet gateway where it would be chopped into a standard MTU size to cross the internet. This manifested itself in significantly lower throughput going from ec2 to the on premise instance.\nAfter discovering this we set the MTU of eth0 on the ec2 instance to 1500 and lowered the OpenVPN tun-mtu to 1500. Since implementing those changes we are achieving equal throughput in both directions!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2016/openvpn-and-ec2-jumbo-frames/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhile troubleshooting site to site links running OpenVPN recently I ran into an issue with MTU sizing on the ec2 end.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been using gmail ever since despite a brief transition to fastmail. It\u0026rsquo;s far from perfect but I\u0026rsquo;m still pretty happy with it. The inbox app by Google is especially great when I\u0026rsquo;m traveling.\nI’ve used Gmail or several years and have really enjoyed the experience. It’s not without its quirks however. Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP client can attest to how wonky things can get. The way Gmail’s All Mail folder functions causes lots of duplicate messages to show up. If a message has a label it will appear in both a folder for that label as well as in the All Mail folder. If you search for a message in the client multiple copies will pop up. The Gmail experience on the iPhone is also annoying. You can setup up Gmail through IMAP just like a desktop client, with all of the duplicate messages, but you can’t get push. That means I have to set my phone to poll the network at a certain interval. This is bad for battery life at high settings and means that messages don’t show up right away. The other option is to set up Gmail though Google sync as an exchange server. You can get push with this option but deleting a message will always archive it. I don’t want to archive all the junk newsletter messages I get. To delete a message with this setup I have to select it and then manually move it to Gmail’s trash folder.\nI’ve also used Google sync to keep my contacts and calendars in sync between all my devices. This also has some annoying limitations, particularly for contacts. The different fields you can sync for each contact are very limited. Google will also take any contact pictures you sync and turn them into a grainy thumbnail. Calendar syncing, for me at least, has usually worked fine.\nEnter iCloud. It is an Apple service designed to be integrated with their products. Great! I immediately switched to iCloud for the syncing of my contacts and calendars. Contacts syncing is much more seamless than it was with Gmail, with much less setup and maintenance required. Calendars worked equally as well. I also signed up for an iCloud mail account back during the beta period but never used it. I was considering making the switch to that as well. When iOS 5 was released I became a little uneasy about this move. Apple’s servers buckled under all the initial sign up traffic and mail was down for several hours. That was already more downtime than I’ve ever experienced with Gmail. I kept thinking about how nice complete integration would be though.\nFinally I decided to go for it. Using Apple Mail I moved all of my messages from Gmail into iCloud. That first night I was happy with the move. The next day I had to pull up an email to print something at work. Like most stupid IT departments Starbucks locks down their computers to only using Internet Explorer. When I tried to pull up iCloud.com to get the message it wouldn’t load. Apple doesn’t support Internet Explorer, and the site won’t even load. Then I got home and tried to send an email to someone on our worship team, but kept getting an error. Turns out that the SMTP server was down. Down again! It was that experience that prompted my “screw this, back to Gmail” tweet. Simply put, email should be reliable. iCloud also uses a custom authentication method and I can’t get it work with Sparrow mail at the moment. Not only that, I logged into iCloud.com today and realized that the web client doesn’t have threaded messaging! Apple mail and the iPhone have had threaded conversations for quite some time, and so did Mobile Me. These products don’t just simply work, and aren’t all that unified in their experience, which is very un-Apple.\nI’m still not sure what I’ll do. I like iCloud contact syncing much better, but if I’m using Gmail it makes sense to keep my contacts synced there. I like using a mail client as well. Sparrow integrates with all of Gmail’s features like labels natively, but I’m favoring Apple Mail these days. On my iPhone I can use another app like Boxcar to get push notifications and then pull up the Gmail site in mobile safari. That still isn’t ideal though. I want my email to work seamlessly with my iPhone since it is what I use for probably 75% of my email, and as good as the Gmail mobile web app, is its still not as smooth as a native application. Hopefully iCloud will get more reliable and gain some features over time, but right now I’m stuck in undecided mode.\nHas anyone had better luck than me?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2015/gmail-to-icloud-to-gmail-again-i-posted/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGmail to iCloud to Gmail again…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI posted several years ago now.

It’s not without its quirks however.  Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP client can attest to how wonky things can get.

I really enjoyed the service in the first few days. It learns from your email habits and moves unimportant messages into a folder called +sanelater. At 4pm each day I would receive an email listing eveything in the +sanelater folder in my inbox.This was great, the mail showing up in my inbox was email from people that I actually wanted to read. Everything else I could review in one swoop at the end of the day without it distracting me…\nAnd then the the service creeped me out. I got a freaking marketing email in my inbox, not the +sanelater folder mind you, asking me to pitch Sanebox for business to my employer.\nHi Daniel,\nThanks for being a SaneBox customer! \u0026gt; We recently rolled out SaneBox for Business to help companies combat email overload in the workplace. I noticed you work for Starbucks and would like to propose our business product for your entire company.\nWho is involved in making this type of decision? If you can connect me it would be much appreciated.\nBest,\nTom Smith | smith@sanebox.com “SaneBox delivers inbox zero daily.”\nIf you don’t want to hear from me about this again, just kindly let me know here.\nI have a couple problems with this. The first one being this. If you are selling a product advertising its ability to remove noise and unimportant email (ie marketing emails) from the inbox and then send your own marketing message directly into the inbox, you are contradicting the entire purpose of your product.\nThe second problem is that this email is just plain creepy.\nI noticed you work for Starbucks and would like to propose our business product for your entire company.\nWhere the hell did they get this information from and why the hell would they find sending this email an acceptable thing to do? I did not provide this information to them. It’s also inaccurate. I used to work at Starbucks. Regardless it is none of their business. I’m having some serious second thoughts about this service now and really want an explanation for this.\nUpdate - Sanebox reached out and let me know they got my employer info from LinkedIn via the rapportive mail plugin. That is publicly available information that I put out there, but it still comes across as creepy when your not expecting it. Sanebox should also filter there own email in the same way they do that of others. For what it’s worth, I really like the service besides this issue. I plan on subscribing after the trial\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2014/sanebox-spammed-me/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"sanebox-spammed-me\"\u003eSanebox Spammed Me\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days ago I signed up for a \u003ca href=\"http://www.sanebox.com\"\u003eSanebox\u003c/a\u003e account after having my curiosity piqued from hearing \u003ca href=\"http://www.macpowerusers.com/2013/11/17/mac-power-users-164-tackling-email/\"\u003eDavid Sparks\u003c/a\u003e talk about it.

It’s a given that I found it entertaining, afterall its overflowing with good Rock n Roll! I’ve also heard the film discussed on many various talk shows, interviews, and podcasts as well as reviews. Most of the discussions focus on one of two story arcs.\nThe first arc is the story of the Neve board Dave bought from Sound City when they closed. In this arc much of the Sound City sound is attributed to this unique Neve console. Dave Grohl goes as far as to say that he wouldn’t be where he is today if it weren’t for that board. The discussion during Grohl’s appearance on the Marc Maron podcast certainly centered around this story. The second story people are quick to latch on to is the analog vs digital debate. A large chunk of the documentary revolves around big bad Pro Tools coming along and ruining both Sound City and the quality of modern music. Sound City was an analog studio. Period. Everyone who recorded there tracked to tape. Most of the artists featured in the documentary were tracking live as well. These great artists are then compared to those tracking everything separately in Pro Tools before editing the crap out of it to creat an artificial performance.\nThis second story arc really captured my attention. I love Rock n Roll and there is something special about old albums. Think about the magic you still here when listening to someone like Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones. Something is different. They seem timeless. Thats not to say that there aren’t classic albums being made today, but far fewer of them have the feel of older music.\nWhich leads us back to the analog vs digital debate. Some believe this debate revolves around the audio quality of the recordings. Tape is better because it sounds better. I’m not hear to debate the truth of that, instead I would suggest that it misses the point. The reason those old records have that magic about them is the constrainsts they were made under. A tape machine limits you to 24 tracks, or 48 if you run a second tape machine in slave mode. If you want to edit a performance you have to take a razor blade, cut out the edit and tape the new piece in. Clearly not something for the faint of heart. The result is that performances are real. Meaning the parts are played as a whole, not chopped up from a large number of takes. Listen to an old interview with Tom Petty talking about how many takes the Heartbreakers did of Refugee before they finally got a keeper. The limitations of taped forced musicians to focus on their performance.\nIt was also common to track most of the instruments together, live in a room and then do minimal overdubs afterwards (remember our track count limit). Everyone had to nail a take for it to be a keeper. Not many artists are even capable of pulling this off today. It requires an extremly high level of playing chops. The constraints lead not only to parts having the feel of a performance, but to things having a live, energetic feel. It sounds organic because it is organic. What you hear is what the microphone heard.\nI believe the final constraint of recording in the analog realm is forced decision making. Not to beat a dead horse, but track count was very limited. Considering many records utilize at least 10 mics on the drum set alone, the number of tracks left for other parts quickly disappears. It was not uncommon to have to bounce a rough mix of drums down to 3 or 4 tracks. In fact this happened on the new Foo Fighter’s record which was recorded entirely to analog tape in Dave Grohl’s garage. This is pulled from a Sound on Sound magazine article about the making of Wasting Light.\nOnce everyone was satisfied with the drum take, a basic four‑track mix consisting of kick, snare and a stereo track of toms and overheads would be bounced onto the slave reel, which became the focus for tracking….. “We were doing everything on the slave reel,” Vig points out, “so by the time we got all the guitars on there, there were usually only four tracks left for vocals and two left for vocal bounces.\nAnd when it came time to mix the album…\nAnd of course, we didn’t have inputs for 48 tracks, so we mixed off the ‘B’ reel. So the drums are all the second generation, pre‑mixed bounce. That’s just the way it was.”\nAs you read the article, you realize that it was the constraints they were working with that lead to Wasting Light sounding the way it does. Constraints bring focus. Sure analog tape has a unique sound to it, but that sound doesn’t make a performance great. The whole point behind pro tools is that it removes constraints from recording. You get a virtually unlimited track count and the ability to edit any piece of audio easily. It is a great tool but it is also easy to get sucked into editing everything to perfection. When that happens, you aren’t hearing a real performance.\nShould we throw away Pro Tools? Absolutely not. Pro Tools is an excellent tool and has done wonders for making recording more accessible. Instead we should be conscious of the way we are working and not give in to the temptation to use every tool at our disposal. Focus on performance and maybe even try tracking things together instead of comping everything separately.\nMy band, Towers recently had a great experience with constraints. A friend of ours needed to record something for a recording class with the stipulation that only 8 tracks were allowed. This forced us to strip the song to its bare bones and be really conscious about what parts were played. Jonathan and I tracked our guitar parts together and only punched in and out twice (amateur hour haha). The drums were all done with two microphones and the vocals done on one track. The thing is, the song sounds really cool and it’s a sound we would never have discovered had it not been for the limitation of 8 tracks. And yes, it was all tracked in Pro Tools. The project’s constraints are what made it special.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2013/sound-city-and-the-analog-vs-digital-debate-like/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"sound-city-and-the-analog-vs-digital-debate\"\u003eSound City and the Analog vs Digital Debate\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many of you, I recently watched the Sound City Documentary Dave Grohl put out.  It’s a given that I found it entertaining, afterall its overflowing with good Rock n Roll!  I’ve also heard the film discussed on many various talk shows, interviews, and podcasts as well as reviews.  Most of the discussions focus on one of two story arcs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first arc is the story of the Neve board Dave bought from Sound City when they closed.  In this arc much of the Sound City sound is attributed to this unique Neve console.  Dave Grohl goes as far as to say that he wouldn’t be where he is today if it weren’t for that board.  The discussion during Grohl’s appearance on the Marc Maron podcast certainly centered around this story.  The second story people are quick to latch on to is the analog vs digital debate.  A large chunk of the documentary revolves around big bad Pro Tools coming along and ruining both Sound City and the quality of modern music.  Sound City was an analog studio.  Period.  Everyone who recorded there tracked to tape.  Most of the artists featured in the documentary were tracking live as well.

I’m no longer a touring musician but I still play music as much as I can. Music is always playing in our house and I can’t imagine living life without it.\nTime has changed the way I listen to music a lot. I came of age in the era of the CD, but ever since I got my first iPod I’ve relied almost entirely on iTunes for my music consumption. At this point I’ve amassed a collection that would take 43 days to listen to.\nSubscription music services are appealing to me because of how much music I listen to music. Even if I’m not super into an album I like being to able to listen to whatever I’d like to without dropping $10 just to here a record. I like to hear what aritsts are doing as well as keep on the production styles artists are employing. Using services like Spotify, Rdio, or Mog this is (mostly) possible. This has led to a battle in my mind about how I will manage my music moving forward.\nCurrently, the majority of my music consumption takes place in iTunes. I use iTunes Match and my library is available to me on any of our computers or phones. However iTunes Match is far from the perfect cloud music solution and its been buggy for me from the start. During this time I’ve used streaming services as a supplement to my iTunes library, rather than my main music service. This is mostly because I’ve been unable to make myself jump in head first with any of the services. Choosing access over ownership is an easy decision with video, and I’m a huge fan of netflix, but music has some barrier in my brain that makes me want to own my music.\nStill, I want to choose access over ownership. The next barrier I’ve been experiencing is that none of the streaming services are without irritating flaws.\nSpotify I know a ton of people using the service\nIt has a large catalog\nbut\nI hate the UI/UX\nI really hate the lack of a collection view\nIt forces you to use playlists as you’re sole version of organization\nThe mobile app is absolutely terrible, largely due to the fact playlists are the only organization used\nRdio I love the UI/UX\nThe desktop app is great\nThe iPhone app is great\nIt lets me actually organize a collection of music apart from playlists\nbut\nI can count on one hand the number of friends using the service, severely diminishing it’s social features\nThe audio quality isn’t very good\nThe catalog lacks some albums I love that are present on the other services\nMOG Best sound quality of the streaming services\nHuge catalog\nExcellent recommendation engine\nbut\nTerrible desktop player\nno library organization features on desktop\nnavigation in the iPhone app requires way too many taps\nAll things considered I enjoy the Rdio experience enough that I would make it my main music hub in a heartbeat if they improved the audio quality. Part of me wants to make the move anyway, but all the albums I own simply sound better in iTunes. I’ve been using MOG as a supplement for a while but their desktop player is severely lagging compared to the competition.\nThere’s really no conclusion to offer here. I continue to use iTunes while experimenting with different streaming services. The cloud aspect of the various services is far superior to iTunes match, but some of the nitpicks listed above can be frustrating. Its also nice to not have to worry about metadata and album art. Maybe someday my desire to break free of my desire for ownership and what I’d like to see in a streaming service will align.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2012/streaming-vs-itunes/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"streaming-music-services-vs-an-itunes-addiction\"\u003eStreaming Music Services VS an iTunes Addiction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic has been a huge part of my life for many years.

Starting college was the main catalyst. At first I had a spiral notebook for each class and I would write any assignments at the top of a page in there. When it came time to complete work I would search through the notebook until I found the proper list. It was unorganized and it didn\u0026rsquo;t scale well. I then tried a few different task management apps on my iPhone, starting with Wunderlist and Appigo ToDo. Wunderlist was free and synced to a desktop counterpart. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t very flexible though. Since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow nested tasks I simply had a bulk school list when I really wanted to separate each class into its own list. I then tried Appigo ToDo which worked pretty well. It didn\u0026rsquo;t have a desktop app at the time though and only worked with iCal and Toodledo.com. Neither of those solutions really fit me and my needs.\nAs a bit of a Mac nerd I had heard different bloggers and tech pundits constantly praising Omnifocus. I also saw a few friends start using it. By all accounts it was a powerful program, but it was also expensive. Eventually I got a killer discount through school on the desktop app and gave it a go. Shawn Blanc has called Omnifocus a sledgehammer and he wasn\u0026rsquo;t kidding. It\u0026rsquo;s almost a full project management suite for your life. This comes with the expense of being complicated with a steeper learning curve. I was only really using it for school and wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what I was doing. The iPhone app was much easier to use but I still felt a little lost. It seemed that learning Omnifocus was a huge project in and of itself.\nOver time I have started to get the hang of it though and I\u0026rsquo;m beginning to rely on it for more than school. My wife and I have a 2 year old and newborn twins, I\u0026rsquo;m a full time college student, and I work part time. To put it mildly, the responsibilities in my life have become a bit overwhelming. I\u0026rsquo;m realizing that even if I don\u0026rsquo;t follow the GTD system to the tee, I need something to dump all these responsiblities into that will help me keep track of what I need to get done. In that spirit, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to immediatley dump things into Omnifocus and teaching myself to use it more throughout the day to decide on what to do. I\u0026rsquo;m slowly getting a handle on the desktop app and its nice to feel more organized. Now if only Omnifocus could create more hours in a day for me!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2012/managing-my-crazy-life-with-a-sledgehammer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI started using task management software slowly as the need to keep track of things began increasing in life.  Starting college was the main catalyst.  At first I had a spiral notebook for each class and I would write any assignments at the top of a page in there.  When it came time to complete work I would search through the notebook until I found the proper list.  It was unorganized and it didn\u0026rsquo;t scale well.  \u003c/p\u003e","title":"Managing my crazy Life with a Sledgehammer"},{"content":"The best take I\u0026rsquo;ve read on Obama\u0026rsquo;s comments in support of gay marriage.\nPresident Obama’s Evolving Views\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2012/president-obamas-evolving-views/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe best take I\u0026rsquo;ve read on Obama\u0026rsquo;s comments in support of gay marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.loveisanorientation.com/2012/president-obamas-evolving-views/\"\u003ePresident Obama’s Evolving Views\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"President Obama’s Evolving Views"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ll be playing bass for Ok Sweetheart.

Thankfully a few minutes at the Apple store and $29 later it was sporting a brand new back. As I thought about it on the train home it started to make more sense.\nSquaretrade sent me a refurbished replacement for my defective iPhone 4 a few months back. I was positive that their replacement used 3rd party glass for the front and the back. There was no oleophobic coating and fingerprints were extremely difficult to wipe off.

Squaretrade responded less than 12 hours later to request pictures. It is difficult to capture with a camera, but I did the best I could. I emailed Squaretrade these pictures at 9pm. The next morning I already had a response in my inbox saying my claim was approved and they would be overnighting a (refurbished) replacement phone.

This new process is pretty user friendly. When I turned not the phone it requested my apple id and password and let me restore from the backup immediately with no iTunes required. The restore process was just as fast as plugging into the computer. Once the phone was done and restored however things got a little funky. All my apps showed up and looked like they were downloading.\nSo far it was an incredibly simple process. But then a dialog box popped up saying my password was incorrect and displaying someone else\u0026rsquo;s apple id? I changed the apple id to the one I had already entered and then received an error saying my apps could not be restored and that I need to plug into iTunes finish downloading them. Sure enough as soon as I plunged in my phone iTunes starting downloading the apps. It was still a strange bug though, and a bit of a security concern that some random persons apple id popped up on my phone. Overall iCloud has been great, and restoring from a backup is simple, but there are still some bugs to be ironed out.

If I\u0026rsquo;m going to archive a message I throw it into a folder in Mail. I also created an archive folder for any mail I want to keep that doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit into a specific folder. In Lion, Mail now has an archive and delete button. Hitting the archive button moves the message to this archive folder, while hitting delete actually deletes the message. If you need to access Gmail through the web app you still have all of your mail available to search in all mail and the new archive label. I like this setup better because I have complete control over whether a message is deleted or archived via Mail\u0026rsquo;s native interface.\nProblem solved (minus push on iPhone).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/make-gmail-play-nice-with-apple-mail/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYesterday I determined a compromise.  I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep using iCloud for\ncontacts and calendars.  Google sync makes a mess of contacts, iCloud \u0026ldquo;just\nworks.\u0026rdquo;  I\u0026rsquo;ll keep using Gmail for my main email.  I\u0026rsquo;ll access it through Apple\nMail on the desktop and the iPhone\u0026rsquo;s built in mail app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s how I set it up to avoid duplicate messages and other craziness.  Log\ninto Gmail\u0026rsquo;s settings and navigate to the labels tab.  Here you can control\nwhich labels show up in IMAP.  What I did was hide all mail, starred, and\nimportant from IMAP.  \u003c/p\u003e","title":"Make Gmail play nice with Apple Mail"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve used Gmail or several years and have really enjoyed the experience. It\u0026rsquo;s not without its quirks however. Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP client can attest to how wonky things can get. The way Gmail\u0026rsquo;s All Mail folder functions causes lots of duplicate messages to show up. If a message has a label it will appear in both a folder for that label as well as in the All Mail folder. If you search for a message in the client multiple copies will pop up. The Gmail experience on the iPhone is also annoying. You can setup up Gmail through IMAP just like a desktop client, with all of the duplicate messages, but you can\u0026rsquo;t get push. That means I have to set my phone to poll the network at a certain interval. This is bad for battery life at high settings and means that messages don\u0026rsquo;t show up right away. The other option is to set up Gmail though Google sync as an exchange server. You can get push with this option but deleting a message will always archive it. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to archive all the junk newsletter messages I get. To delete a message with this setup I have to select it and then manually move it to Gmail\u0026rsquo;s trash folder.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also used Google sync to keep my contacts and calendars in sync between all my devices. This also has some annoying limitations, particularly for contacts. The different fields you can sync for each contact are very limited. Google will also take any contact pictures you sync and turn them into a grainy thumbnail. Calendar syncing, for me at least, has usually worked fine.\nEnter iCloud. It is an Apple service designed to be integrated with their products. Great! I immediately switched to iCloud for the syncing of my contacts and calendars. Contacts syncing is much more seamless than it was with Gmail, with much less setup and maintenance required. Calendars worked equally as well. I also signed up for an iCloud mail account back during the beta period but never used it. I was considering making the switch to that as well. When iOS 5 was released I became a little uneasy about this move. Apple\u0026rsquo;s servers buckled under all the initial sign up traffic and mail was down for several hours. That was already more downtime than I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced with Gmail. I kept thinking about how nice complete integration would be though. Finally I decided to go for it. Using Apple Mail I moved all of my messages from Gmail into iCloud. That first night I was happy with the move. The next day I had to pull up an email to print something at work. Like most stupid IT departments Starbucks locks down their computers to only using Internet Explorer. When I tried to pull up iCloud.com to get the message it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t load. Apple doesn\u0026rsquo;t support Internet Explorer, and the site won\u0026rsquo;t even load. Then I got home and tried to send an email to someone on our worship team, but kept getting an error. Turns out that the SMTP server was down. Down again! It was that experience that prompted my \u0026ldquo;screw this, back to Gmail\u0026rdquo; tweet. . Simply put, email should be reliable. iCloud also uses a custom authentication method and I can\u0026rsquo;t get it work with Sparrow mail at the moment. Not only that, I logged into iCloud.com today and realized that the web client doesn\u0026rsquo;t have threaded messaging! Apple mail and the iPhone have had threaded conversations for quite some time, and so did Mobile Me. These products don\u0026rsquo;t just simply work, and aren\u0026rsquo;t all that unified in their experience, which is very un-Apple.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still not sure what I\u0026rsquo;ll do. I like iCloud contact syncing much better, but if I\u0026rsquo;m using Gmail it makes sense to keep my contacts synced there. I like using a mail client as well. Sparrow integrates with all of Gmail\u0026rsquo;s features like labels natively, but I\u0026rsquo;m favoring Apple Mail these days. On my iPhone I can use another app like Boxcar to get push notifications and then pull up the Gmail site in mobile safari. That still isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal though. I want my email to work seamlessly with my iPhone since it is what I use for probably 75% of my email, and as good as the Gmail mobile web app, is its still not as smooth as a native application. Hopefully iCloud will get more reliable and gain some features over time, but right now I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in undecided mode.\nHas anyone had better luck than me?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/gmail-to-icloud-to-gmail-again/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve used Gmail or several years and have really enjoyed the experience.  It\u0026rsquo;s\nnot without its quirks however.  Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP\nclient can attest to how wonky things can get.  The way Gmail\u0026rsquo;s All Mail folder\nfunctions causes lots of duplicate messages to show up.  If a message has a\nlabel it will appear in both a folder for that label as well as in the All Mail\nfolder.  If you search for a message in the client multiple copies will pop up.\nThe Gmail experience on the iPhone is also annoying.  You can setup up Gmail\nthrough IMAP just like a desktop client, with all of the duplicate messages, but\nyou can\u0026rsquo;t get push.  That means I have to set my phone to poll the network at a\ncertain interval.  This is bad for battery life at high settings and means that\nmessages don\u0026rsquo;t show up right away.  The other option is to set up Gmail though\nGoogle sync as an exchange server.  You can get push with this option but\ndeleting a message will always archive it.  I don\u0026rsquo;t want to archive all the junk\nnewsletter messages I get.  To delete a message with this setup I have to select\nit and then manually move it to Gmail\u0026rsquo;s trash folder.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Gmail to iCloud to Gmail again..."},{"content":"We got to see the twins again today.

Galena, IL.  It\u0026rsquo;s a beautiful little historic town with its own charm.  One of my highlights is always grabbing a beer from the Galena Brewing Company.  This year I also added climbing the massive staircase to my list. The reward is an amazing view from the top.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Fall in Galena"},{"content":"I love Apple and the products they create. I always had an interest in gadgets but was too busy playing guitar and trying to keep an old Dell laptop working to take it much further than that. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I moved to Chicago and bought my first Macbook Pro that I fell in love technology. There is something in the design of Apple products that makes them a pleasure to use, and that is thanks to the vision and genius of Steve Jobs. Tributes to Steve are all over the internet right now, and rightly so, but I think there is a greater tragedy in his death that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been picked up on. I was reading a post about the biography of Steve Jobs where the author was talking about why Steve had decided to be so open with him after such a history of keeping things close to the chest. Here is Steve\u0026rsquo;s response.\n“I wanted my kids to know me,” he said. “I wasn’t always there for them, and I wanted them to know why and to understand what I did.”\nFor a man to accomplish so much, running a company in such a hands on way other areas of life had to budge. Think about all the time Steve spent working, and then think about that time subtracted from his children. That is a sacrifice he made to create what he did.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to read to much into this quote and assume things. So I will stop here, and simply say that I think this is representative of a sad pattern in our country today. The pattern that parents leave most of the parenting of their children up to their daily caretakers. Our kids need us. Lets not ignore our children while we\u0026rsquo;re out looking to change the world. Let us actively seek balance.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/a-different-tragedy-in-steve-jobs-death/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI love Apple and the products they create.  I always had an interest in gadgets\nbut was too busy playing guitar and trying to keep an old Dell laptop working to\ntake it much further than that.  It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I moved to Chicago and bought\nmy first Macbook Pro that I fell in love technology.

Later I started going to the same Church he did. I spent a couple years playing guitar on the worship team while he played drums. Later he would join Memphis Belle (unfortunately near the bands end) and we would tour the country together. Randy is extremely creative and talented and I have the utmost respect for him. When I moved to Chicago we jammed by email with a few dirty garage songs. Later he recorded A Worthy Chronicle and asked me to mix it. I had spent several months interning for a major recording studio and spent time around some truly great engineers. I had not, however, ever fully mixed anything myself besides messing around at the studio. It was no brainer for me to tackle mixing these songs. Right after I started Tif and I had Mylin. It turns out learning effective time management while raising a child, attending school full time, and playing in a band isn\u0026rsquo;t so easy. Randy was VERY gracious with the fact that it took me over a year to complete. It was a lot of fun and some great practice. If I were to tackle this project now it would probably only take me a few weeks to complete, at most. I really like the personality of these songs. Do me a favor and give the record a download.

I thought I\u0026rsquo;d highlight how you can use a similar workflow in Atlassian\u0026rsquo;s Bamboo application. This assumes you already have a working Bamboo setup and are familiar with the general process for testing Puppet modules with rspec.\nCreate a new plan The first step is to set up a new plan to use for the testing. Click \u0026ldquo;Create\u0026rdquo; and then \u0026ldquo;Create a new plan\u0026rdquo; in the top menu bar.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_08_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_08_pm.png)\nBamboo organizes related jobs, builds, etc. into projects. On the next screen either create a new Puppet project or select an existing project if you\u0026rsquo;ve already set that up.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_10_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_10_pm.png)\nFill in the details and select the repository you\u0026rsquo;d like to start testing. Bamboo can read from a large number of version control systems. I happen to use Bitbucket so this is simple. Once your happy with the selections click \u0026ldquo;Configure plan\u0026rdquo;.\n![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_15_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_15_pm.png)\nAt the next screen we setup our tasks. The first task, Source Code Checkout, is added by default and checks out the repo configured in the previous step. I like to break things down into small script tasks so they are easier to troubleshoot and duplicate between jobs.\nClick add task and select script.\n![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_17_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_17_pm.png)\nThe first step is to setup the Ruby environment. This presumes you already have Bamboo build agents up and running and that rvm is installed. This script below is what I use. It performs some checks to ensure ruby is properly setup.\n#!/bin/bash if [ \u0026#34;$(ps -p \u0026#34;$$\u0026#34; -o comm=)\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34; ]; then /bin/bash \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; exit \u0026#34;$?\u0026#34; fi source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh ruby=\u0026#34;ruby-2.1.8\u0026#34; install_count=`rvm list | grep $ruby | wc -l` if [ $install_count -lt 1 ]; then rvm install $ruby fi rvm use $ruby rvm user gemsets Now click \u0026ldquo;Add task\u0026rdquo; and add another script task. We will use this script step to create a new gemset and install the gems listed in the Gemfile using bundler. If you use environment variables to specify the version of puppet to install enter that in the environment variables field.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_55_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_55_pm.png)\n#!/bin/bash if [ \u0026#34;$(ps -p \u0026#34;$$\u0026#34; -o comm=)\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34; ]; then /bin/bash \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; exit \u0026#34;$?\u0026#34; fi source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh ruby=\u0026#34;ruby-2.1.8\u0026#34; gemset=\u0026#34;puppet-4.8.0-validate\u0026#34; rvm use $ruby rvm user gemsets rvm gemset create $gemset rvm gemset use $gemset gem install bundler rm Gemfile.lock bundle install Now lets add another script step and use it to run the actual tests. At the end of the test this removes the Gemset to ensure a clean environment for each new run. You can also add other options here using environment variables such as STRICT_VARIABLES=no.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_30_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_30_pm.png)\n#!/bin/bash if [ \u0026#34;$(ps -p \u0026#34;$$\u0026#34; -o comm=)\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34; ]; then /bin/bash \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; exit \u0026#34;$?\u0026#34; fi source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh ruby=\u0026#34;ruby-2.1.8\u0026#34; gemset=\u0026#34;puppet-4.8.0-validate\u0026#34; rvm use $ruby rvm user gemsets rvm gemset use $gemset bundle exec rake validate bundle exec rake spec rvm gemset delete --force $gemset We\u0026rsquo;ve now covered the basics needed to get started and can click create at the bottom to finalize the plan. After doing so we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at the job configuration page. The script tasks we just created are in the \u0026ldquo;Default Job\u0026rdquo;.\n![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_33_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_33_pm.png)That name isn\u0026rsquo;t very clear so lets update it. Click \u0026ldquo;Default Job\u0026rdquo; and then select the \u0026ldquo;Job details\u0026rdquo; tab. Here we\u0026rsquo;ll enter a more descriptive name such as \u0026ldquo;Puppet 4.8 rspec\u0026rdquo; and click save. A descriptive name is handy because you can clone stages across plans to avoid repeating the script setup.\nRepository Triggers If you\u0026rsquo;re using the built in Bitbucket Server integration like my setup then Bamboo will automatically run the plan whenever a new commit is pushed to the repo. You can customize the type of trigger to use polling, scheduling, or other options as well. Simply select the \u0026ldquo;Triggers\u0026rdquo; tab under plan configuration and set appropriately.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_37_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_37_pm.png)\nTracking Results If you were to run this plan now you would get a pass or fail in Bamboo but would have to look at the logs for the job to see the actual details of the results. We can use JUnit to get an better view of the test in Bamboo. To set this up create a .rspec file in the root of the Puppet module you\u0026rsquo;re testing with the following content\n--format RspecJunitFormatter --out results.xml This will write the results of the test in JUnit format to the results.xml file. You\u0026rsquo;ll also want to add this file to .gitignore. Now we can add a step to our plan to parse this file. Go back to the plan configuration and select the stage we setup previously. Click add task and select \u0026ldquo;JUnit Parser.\u0026rdquo;![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_41_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_41_pm.png)\nConfigure the JUnit parser so it finds our results file.![Pasted_Image_1_13_17__3_42_PM.png]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/pasted_image_1_13_17__3_42_pm.png)\nClick save and run the plan again. You\u0026rsquo;ll now see your test results nicely formatted in the plan history.

Overall I\u0026rsquo;d say the process was pretty painless. The gist of what I did\nstart running rspec tests against Puppet 4\nfix issues found in tests\nrun the catalog preview tool and fix any issues found\nturn on the future parser on the existing master\nturn off stringify facts\ncreate new master and PuppeDB server\nmigrate agents to new master\nThankfully our code wasn\u0026rsquo;t too difficult to update and most of the forge modules we use had also been updated.\nCreating the New Master I did not want to upgrade our existing master for a variety of reasons I won\u0026rsquo;t get into here. Instead I took the opportunity to migrate it from an old vm to running on ec2 with PuppetDB in RDS. I have to give props to the puppet team for greatly simplifying the setup process of a new master in Puppet 4. Setting up puppetserver is significantly easier then the old passenger based server.\nMigrating the Agents Puppet provides a module to migrate your agents to the new master. It will copy the existing ssl certs to the new directory and upgrade the agent. I was not able to do this since I was not migrating certs to the new master (I needed to add new DNS alt names). The consequence of this was needing to find a way to upgrade and migrate the agents in an automated fashion. I accomplished this entirely with puppet! The process was\npre-create /etc/puppetlabs/puppet\ndrop a new config into /etc/puppetlabs.puppet/puppet.conf with the new master name\nsetup the puppetlabs puppet collection repo\ninstall the new puppet-agent package\nupdate cron job for new puppet paths (the fact that I already ran puppet using cron made this simple)\npurge the old /etc/puppet directory\nA puppet run would take place on the old master and prep things using the steps above. Then when the cronjob kicked in it would run against the new master and get a new cert issued. Overall this worked really well and we only had to touch 2 machines by hand.\nMigrate Puppet Manifest This is the manifest I used to migrate our linux machines.

Somehow I had overlooked the removal of dynamic scoping in ERB templates. This piece of code was not covered by rspec tests, an area for improvement! I relied on this to configure logstash output to elasticsearch. Under Puppet 3 the relevant piece of ERB looked like this\noutput { if [type] == \u0026#34;syslog\u0026#34; { elasticsearch { hosts =\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;%= @es_input_nodes.collect { |node| \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; + node.to_s + \u0026#39;:\u0026#39; + @elasticsearch_port.to_s + \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; }.join(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;] ssl =\u0026gt; true } } The value of es_input_nodes was pulled from the params class\nclass elk::logstash ( $syslog_port = $elk::params::syslog_port, $elasticsearch_nodes = $elk::params::elasticsearch_nodes, $es_input_nodes = $elk::params::es_input_nodes, $elasticsearch_port = $elk::params::elasticsearch_port, $netflow_port = $elk::params::netflow_port ) The params class pulls the info from Puppet DB.\n$es_input_nodes = sort(query_nodes(\u0026#39;Class[Elk::elasticsearch] and elasticsearchrole=data or elasticsearchrole=client\u0026#39;)) The removal of dynamic scoping templates meant the template was putting empty values in the logstash config and breaking the service. To fix the variables needed to be scoped properly in the template and now look like this\noutput { if [type] == \u0026#34;syslog\u0026#34; { elasticsearch { hosts =\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;%= scope[\u0026#39;elk::logstash::es_input_nodes\u0026#39;].collect { |node| \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; + node.to_s + \u0026#39;:\u0026#39; + scope[\u0026#39;elk::logstash::elasticsearch_port\u0026#39;].to_s + \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; }.join(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;] ssl =\u0026gt; true } } Remaining Work Prior to the migration I relied on stephenrjohnson/pupptmodule to manage the puppet agent on Linux and macOS. Some work has been done on Puppet 4 compatability but there is still more to do. I\u0026rsquo;m close to updating the agent pieces for my needs but there is a lot of work to add puppet master support.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2016/finishing-the-puppet-4-migration/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTwo days ago I finished our migration to Puppet 4.

Let me state upfront that I do not believe paying attention to the chat room all day and having your attention interrupted non-stop is a productive or healthy practice. I have found some big benefits to \u0026ldquo;chatops\u0026rdquo; however.\nVisibility Work that is done in the chatroom, or filtered into the chatroom, is visible to the whole team. This helps the team be aware of what others are doing and stay up to date. I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up on quite a few things from this that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have learned other wise. This is also why we choose to route a fair amount of notifications into chat. For example we have Jira connected to HipChat and it makes it really easy to stay on top of issues. We also push commit notifications, build notifications, etc in the chatroom. The downside to this is that the rooms get noisy and make it harder to follow actual conversations between humans. One strategy we use to combat that is creating multiple rooms and focusing them around a subject.\nLess Context Switching I have the ability to accomplish a task without context switching using bots even better then the visibility wins. We have HipChat open all day. It is far quicker to switch the focus to the HipChat window, slam in a command, and get back to what we were doing then it is to ssh into a server, run a command, and then log back out. My co-worker got inspired by Kevin Paulisse\u0026rsquo;s talk at puppet conf and their use of Hubot and led us to get our chatops on using the open source bot Lita. We\u0026rsquo;ve already done some work on our own plugins and I\u0026rsquo;m now sold on working this way.\nUsing Lita Working with Active Directory Our lita-activedirectory plugin allows us to leverage our cratus gem to query and interact with Active Directory over ldap. It currently supports checking if a user account is locked, and unlocking the user account. We plan to extend to allow querying for group memberships and other attributes. One less reason to open Active Directory Users and Computers!\nWorking with Puppet Our [lita-puppet[(https://github.com/knuedge/lita-puppet) plugin lets interact with our puppet infrastructure and puppetdb. Some tasks it currently supports\nlist all nodes containing a specific class list all the profile and role classes applied to a node clean a cert off the puppet master run the puppet agent on a node deploy code with r10k on the puppet master Other Cool Uses We\u0026rsquo;ve implemented other helpful abilities\nrun a dns lookup using dig ping a name or IP test for the availability of a URL Reset OTP tokens It has been huge to accomplish these tasks without leaving the keyboard in an app I already have open all the time.

This is also why we choose to route a fair amount of notifications into chat. For example we have Jira connected to HipChat and it makes it really easy to stay on top of issues. We also push commit notifications, build notifications, etc in the chatroom. The downside to this is that the rooms get noisy and make it harder to follow actual conversations between humans. One strategy we use to combat that is creating multiple rooms and focusing them around a subject.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"No Longer Barfing at the Mention of ChatOps"},{"content":"This is immensely useful, and has been a huge time saver.\n[gallery size=full columns=1]\n—Practical 365\n“PowerShell is an efficient way to perform management tasks for Office 365, and also allows a great deal of automation through the use of PowerShell scripts to perform routine and repetitive tasks.”\nhttp://feeds.feedblitz.com//203571740/0/practical365Saving-Credentials-for-Office-PowerShell-Scripts-and-Scheduled-Tasks/\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2016/saving-credentials-for-office-365-powershell-scripts-and-scheduled-tasks/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is immensely useful, and has been a huge time saver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[gallery size=full columns=1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Practical 365\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“PowerShell is an efficient way to perform management tasks for Office 365, and also allows a great deal of automation through the use of PowerShell scripts to perform routine and repetitive tasks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/203571740/0/practical365~Saving-Credentials-for-Office-PowerShell-Scripts-and-Scheduled-Tasks/\"\u003ehttp://feeds.feedblitz.com/\u003cdel\u003e/203571740/0/practical365\u003c/del\u003eSaving-Credentials-for-Office-PowerShell-Scripts-and-Scheduled-Tasks/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Saving Credentials for Office 365 PowerShell Scripts and Scheduled Tasks"},{"content":"This is excellent.\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bRNJ9UVVZNY\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2016/thrice-1979-smashing-pumpkins-cover-live-siriusxm-octane-youtube/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is excellent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bRNJ9UVVZNY\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\"\u003ehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bRNJ9UVVZNY\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Thrice \"1979\" Smashing Pumpkins Cover Live @ SiriusXM // Octane - YouTube"},{"content":"You have a directory with data, and now you\u0026rsquo;ve mounted a volume over it.

When we originally setup the links we followed the performance tuning advice found here. The relevant portion is that we set tun-mtu 6000 Why did we do this? Here\u0026rsquo;s OpenVPN\u0026rsquo;s explanation\nBy increasing the MTU size of the tun adapter and by disabling OpenVPN's internal fragmentation routines the throughput can be increased quite dramatically. The reason behind this is that by feeding larger packets to the OpenSSL encryption and decryption routines the performance will go up. The second advantage of not internally fragmenting packets is that this is left to the operating system and to the kernel network device drivers. For a LAN-based setup this can work, but when handling various types of remote users (road warriors, cable modem users, etc) this is not always a possibility. During later testing we discovered that we could easily push 40mb/s over the OpenVPN tunnel into the ec2 instance, but only 1mb/s or less going the opposite direction. Obviously not ideal.\nSo how does ec2 MTU sizing play into this? We had on premise VMs on one side with a standard mtu of 1500 on their interfaces while the ec2 instance had jumbo frames enabled with an mtu of 9001. This meant that our traffic towards ec2 was being fragmented into an MTU of 1500 by linux on the on premise OpenVPN instance. Traffic out of ec2 towards the other end was not fragmented by the vpn instance at all and was sent along to the internet gateway where it would be chopped into a standard MTU size to cross the internet. This manifested itself in significantly lower throughput going from ec2 to the on premise instance.\nAfter discovering this we set the MTU of eth0 on the ec2 instance to 1500 and lowered the OpenVPN tun-mtu to 1500. Since implementing those changes we are achieving equal throughput in both directions!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2016/openvpn-and-ec2-jumbo-frames/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhile troubleshooting site to site links running OpenVPN recently I ran into an issue with MTU sizing on the ec2 end.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been using gmail ever since despite a brief transition to fastmail. It\u0026rsquo;s far from perfect but I\u0026rsquo;m still pretty happy with it. The inbox app by Google is especially great when I\u0026rsquo;m traveling.\nI’ve used Gmail or several years and have really enjoyed the experience. It’s not without its quirks however. Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP client can attest to how wonky things can get. The way Gmail’s All Mail folder functions causes lots of duplicate messages to show up. If a message has a label it will appear in both a folder for that label as well as in the All Mail folder. If you search for a message in the client multiple copies will pop up. The Gmail experience on the iPhone is also annoying. You can setup up Gmail through IMAP just like a desktop client, with all of the duplicate messages, but you can’t get push. That means I have to set my phone to poll the network at a certain interval. This is bad for battery life at high settings and means that messages don’t show up right away. The other option is to set up Gmail though Google sync as an exchange server. You can get push with this option but deleting a message will always archive it. I don’t want to archive all the junk newsletter messages I get. To delete a message with this setup I have to select it and then manually move it to Gmail’s trash folder.\nI’ve also used Google sync to keep my contacts and calendars in sync between all my devices. This also has some annoying limitations, particularly for contacts. The different fields you can sync for each contact are very limited. Google will also take any contact pictures you sync and turn them into a grainy thumbnail. Calendar syncing, for me at least, has usually worked fine.\nEnter iCloud. It is an Apple service designed to be integrated with their products. Great! I immediately switched to iCloud for the syncing of my contacts and calendars. Contacts syncing is much more seamless than it was with Gmail, with much less setup and maintenance required. Calendars worked equally as well. I also signed up for an iCloud mail account back during the beta period but never used it. I was considering making the switch to that as well. When iOS 5 was released I became a little uneasy about this move. Apple’s servers buckled under all the initial sign up traffic and mail was down for several hours. That was already more downtime than I’ve ever experienced with Gmail. I kept thinking about how nice complete integration would be though.\nFinally I decided to go for it. Using Apple Mail I moved all of my messages from Gmail into iCloud. That first night I was happy with the move. The next day I had to pull up an email to print something at work. Like most stupid IT departments Starbucks locks down their computers to only using Internet Explorer. When I tried to pull up iCloud.com to get the message it wouldn’t load. Apple doesn’t support Internet Explorer, and the site won’t even load. Then I got home and tried to send an email to someone on our worship team, but kept getting an error. Turns out that the SMTP server was down. Down again! It was that experience that prompted my “screw this, back to Gmail” tweet. Simply put, email should be reliable. iCloud also uses a custom authentication method and I can’t get it work with Sparrow mail at the moment. Not only that, I logged into iCloud.com today and realized that the web client doesn’t have threaded messaging! Apple mail and the iPhone have had threaded conversations for quite some time, and so did Mobile Me. These products don’t just simply work, and aren’t all that unified in their experience, which is very un-Apple.\nI’m still not sure what I’ll do. I like iCloud contact syncing much better, but if I’m using Gmail it makes sense to keep my contacts synced there. I like using a mail client as well. Sparrow integrates with all of Gmail’s features like labels natively, but I’m favoring Apple Mail these days. On my iPhone I can use another app like Boxcar to get push notifications and then pull up the Gmail site in mobile safari. That still isn’t ideal though. I want my email to work seamlessly with my iPhone since it is what I use for probably 75% of my email, and as good as the Gmail mobile web app, is its still not as smooth as a native application. Hopefully iCloud will get more reliable and gain some features over time, but right now I’m stuck in undecided mode.\nHas anyone had better luck than me?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2015/gmail-to-icloud-to-gmail-again-i-posted/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGmail to iCloud to Gmail again…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI posted several years ago now.

A risk.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://aeon.co/magazine/society/step-by-step-americans-are-sacrificing-the-right-to-walk/#%23For\u0026#43;decades,\u0026#43;Americans\u0026#43;have\u0026#43;been\u0026#43;losing\u0026#43;their\u0026#43;ability,\u0026#43;even\u0026#43;their\u0026#43;right,\u0026#43;to\u0026#43;walk.\u0026#43;There\u0026#43;are\u0026#43;places\u0026#43;in\u0026#43;the\u0026#43;United\u0026#43;States\u0026#43;%E2%80%93\u0026#43;New\u0026#43;York\u0026#43;City,\u0026#43;for\u0026#43;example\u0026#43;%E2%80%93\u0026#43;where\u0026#43;people\u0026#43;walk\u0026#43;as\u0026#43;a\u0026#43;matter\u0026#43;of\u0026#43;habit\u0026#43;and\u0026#43;lifestyle,\u0026#43;commuting\u0026#43;in\u0026#43;ways\u0026#43;familiar\u0026#43;to\u0026#43;residents\u0026#43;of\u0026#43;London\u0026#43;or\u0026#43;Paris.\u0026#43;But\u0026#43;there\u0026#43;are\u0026#43;vast\u0026#43;blankets\u0026#43;and\u0026#43;folds\u0026#43;of\u0026#43;the\u0026#43;country\u0026#43;where\u0026#43;the\u0026#43;ability\u0026#43;to\u0026#43;walk\u0026#43;%E2%80%93\u0026#43;to\u0026#43;open\u0026#43;a\u0026#43;door\u0026#43;and\u0026#43;step\u0026#43;outside\u0026#43;and\u0026#43;go\u0026#43;somewhere\u0026#43;or\u0026#43;nowhere\u0026#43;without\u0026#43;getting\u0026#43;behind\u0026#43;the\u0026#43;wheel\u0026#43;of\u0026#43;a\u0026#43;car\u0026#43;%E2%80%93\u0026#43;is\u0026#43;a\u0026#43;struggle,\u0026#43;a\u0026#43;fight.\u0026#43;A\u0026#43;risk.\"\u003eWe are sacrificing the right to walk – Antonia Malchick – Aeon\u003c/a\u003e (via \u003ca href=\"http://www.kungfugrippe.com/\"\u003emerlin\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e","title":"No Content Found"},{"content":"[gallery]\nmorelala:\nThey Came Together \u0026 Wet Hot American Summer \u003e \u003e ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2015/morelala-they-came-together-wet-hot-american/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e[gallery]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://morelala.tumblr.com/post/125564984044/they-came-together-wet-hot-american-summer\"\u003emorelala\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003eThey Came Together \u0026 Wet Hot American Summer\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003c/blockquote\u003e","title":"No Content Found"},{"content":"[gallery]\nLooking good San Diego.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2014/looking-good-san-diego/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e[gallery]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking good San Diego.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"No Content Found"},{"content":"\nCreeper in the corner\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2014/creeper-in-the-corner/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielschaaff.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/tumblr_nhbulm1cvb1qcnv82o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreeper in the corner\u003c/p\u003e","title":"No Content Found"},{"content":"\nChristmas is getting real in here. with Tiffany – View on Path.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2014/christmas-is-getting-real-in-here-with-tiffany/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielschaaff.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/tumblr_ngl86uy7gu1qcnv82o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristmas is getting real in here. with Tiffany – View on \u003ca href=\"https://path.com/p/qXp0\"\u003ePath\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"No Content Found"},{"content":"\nBringing it back\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2014/bringing-it-back/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielschaaff.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/tumblr_nggcm17tul1qcnv82o1_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBringing it back\u003c/p\u003e","title":"No Content Found"},{"content":"Walking With God Through Doubt — Mike McHargue (aka \u0026ldquo;Science Mike\u0026rdquo;)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2014/walking-with-god-through-doubt-mike-mchargue/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://mikemchargue.com/blog/2014/10/16/walking-with-god-through-doubt\"\u003eWalking With God Through Doubt — Mike McHargue (aka \u0026ldquo;Science Mike\u0026rdquo;)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Walking With God Through Doubt — Mike McHargue (aka \"Science Mike\")"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m pumped for this record!\nRancid - \u0026ldquo;Collision Course,\u0026rdquo;

I really enjoyed the service in the first few days. It learns from your email habits and moves unimportant messages into a folder called +sanelater. At 4pm each day I would receive an email listing eveything in the +sanelater folder in my inbox.This was great, the mail showing up in my inbox was email from people that I actually wanted to read. Everything else I could review in one swoop at the end of the day without it distracting me…\nAnd then the the service creeped me out. I got a freaking marketing email in my inbox, not the +sanelater folder mind you, asking me to pitch Sanebox for business to my employer.\nHi Daniel,\nThanks for being a SaneBox customer! \u0026gt; We recently rolled out SaneBox for Business to help companies combat email overload in the workplace. I noticed you work for Starbucks and would like to propose our business product for your entire company.\nWho is involved in making this type of decision? If you can connect me it would be much appreciated.\nBest,\nTom Smith | smith@sanebox.com “SaneBox delivers inbox zero daily.”\nIf you don’t want to hear from me about this again, just kindly let me know here.\nI have a couple problems with this. The first one being this. If you are selling a product advertising its ability to remove noise and unimportant email (ie marketing emails) from the inbox and then send your own marketing message directly into the inbox, you are contradicting the entire purpose of your product.\nThe second problem is that this email is just plain creepy.\nI noticed you work for Starbucks and would like to propose our business product for your entire company.\nWhere the hell did they get this information from and why the hell would they find sending this email an acceptable thing to do? I did not provide this information to them. It’s also inaccurate. I used to work at Starbucks. Regardless it is none of their business. I’m having some serious second thoughts about this service now and really want an explanation for this.\nUpdate - Sanebox reached out and let me know they got my employer info from LinkedIn via the rapportive mail plugin. That is publicly available information that I put out there, but it still comes across as creepy when your not expecting it. Sanebox should also filter there own email in the same way they do that of others. For what it’s worth, I really like the service besides this issue. I plan on subscribing after the trial\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2014/sanebox-spammed-me/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"sanebox-spammed-me\"\u003eSanebox Spammed Me\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days ago I signed up for a \u003ca href=\"http://www.sanebox.com\"\u003eSanebox\u003c/a\u003e account after having my curiosity piqued from hearing \u003ca href=\"http://www.macpowerusers.com/2013/11/17/mac-power-users-164-tackling-email/\"\u003eDavid Sparks\u003c/a\u003e talk about it.

It’s a given that I found it entertaining, afterall its overflowing with good Rock n Roll! I’ve also heard the film discussed on many various talk shows, interviews, and podcasts as well as reviews. Most of the discussions focus on one of two story arcs.\nThe first arc is the story of the Neve board Dave bought from Sound City when they closed. In this arc much of the Sound City sound is attributed to this unique Neve console. Dave Grohl goes as far as to say that he wouldn’t be where he is today if it weren’t for that board. The discussion during Grohl’s appearance on the Marc Maron podcast certainly centered around this story. The second story people are quick to latch on to is the analog vs digital debate. A large chunk of the documentary revolves around big bad Pro Tools coming along and ruining both Sound City and the quality of modern music. Sound City was an analog studio. Period. Everyone who recorded there tracked to tape. Most of the artists featured in the documentary were tracking live as well. These great artists are then compared to those tracking everything separately in Pro Tools before editing the crap out of it to creat an artificial performance.\nThis second story arc really captured my attention. I love Rock n Roll and there is something special about old albums. Think about the magic you still here when listening to someone like Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones. Something is different. They seem timeless. Thats not to say that there aren’t classic albums being made today, but far fewer of them have the feel of older music.\nWhich leads us back to the analog vs digital debate. Some believe this debate revolves around the audio quality of the recordings. Tape is better because it sounds better. I’m not hear to debate the truth of that, instead I would suggest that it misses the point. The reason those old records have that magic about them is the constrainsts they were made under. A tape machine limits you to 24 tracks, or 48 if you run a second tape machine in slave mode. If you want to edit a performance you have to take a razor blade, cut out the edit and tape the new piece in. Clearly not something for the faint of heart. The result is that performances are real. Meaning the parts are played as a whole, not chopped up from a large number of takes. Listen to an old interview with Tom Petty talking about how many takes the Heartbreakers did of Refugee before they finally got a keeper. The limitations of taped forced musicians to focus on their performance.\nIt was also common to track most of the instruments together, live in a room and then do minimal overdubs afterwards (remember our track count limit). Everyone had to nail a take for it to be a keeper. Not many artists are even capable of pulling this off today. It requires an extremly high level of playing chops. The constraints lead not only to parts having the feel of a performance, but to things having a live, energetic feel. It sounds organic because it is organic. What you hear is what the microphone heard.\nI believe the final constraint of recording in the analog realm is forced decision making. Not to beat a dead horse, but track count was very limited. Considering many records utilize at least 10 mics on the drum set alone, the number of tracks left for other parts quickly disappears. It was not uncommon to have to bounce a rough mix of drums down to 3 or 4 tracks. In fact this happened on the new Foo Fighter’s record which was recorded entirely to analog tape in Dave Grohl’s garage. This is pulled from a Sound on Sound magazine article about the making of Wasting Light.\nOnce everyone was satisfied with the drum take, a basic four‑track mix consisting of kick, snare and a stereo track of toms and overheads would be bounced onto the slave reel, which became the focus for tracking….. “We were doing everything on the slave reel,” Vig points out, “so by the time we got all the guitars on there, there were usually only four tracks left for vocals and two left for vocal bounces.\nAnd when it came time to mix the album…\nAnd of course, we didn’t have inputs for 48 tracks, so we mixed off the ‘B’ reel. So the drums are all the second generation, pre‑mixed bounce. That’s just the way it was.”\nAs you read the article, you realize that it was the constraints they were working with that lead to Wasting Light sounding the way it does. Constraints bring focus. Sure analog tape has a unique sound to it, but that sound doesn’t make a performance great. The whole point behind pro tools is that it removes constraints from recording. You get a virtually unlimited track count and the ability to edit any piece of audio easily. It is a great tool but it is also easy to get sucked into editing everything to perfection. When that happens, you aren’t hearing a real performance.\nShould we throw away Pro Tools? Absolutely not. Pro Tools is an excellent tool and has done wonders for making recording more accessible. Instead we should be conscious of the way we are working and not give in to the temptation to use every tool at our disposal. Focus on performance and maybe even try tracking things together instead of comping everything separately.\nMy band, Towers recently had a great experience with constraints. A friend of ours needed to record something for a recording class with the stipulation that only 8 tracks were allowed. This forced us to strip the song to its bare bones and be really conscious about what parts were played. Jonathan and I tracked our guitar parts together and only punched in and out twice (amateur hour haha). The drums were all done with two microphones and the vocals done on one track. The thing is, the song sounds really cool and it’s a sound we would never have discovered had it not been for the limitation of 8 tracks. And yes, it was all tracked in Pro Tools. The project’s constraints are what made it special.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2013/sound-city-and-the-analog-vs-digital-debate-like/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"sound-city-and-the-analog-vs-digital-debate\"\u003eSound City and the Analog vs Digital Debate\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many of you, I recently watched the Sound City Documentary Dave Grohl put out.

I’m no longer a touring musician but I still play music as much as I can. Music is always playing in our house and I can’t imagine living life without it.\nTime has changed the way I listen to music a lot. I came of age in the era of the CD, but ever since I got my first iPod I’ve relied almost entirely on iTunes for my music consumption. At this point I’ve amassed a collection that would take 43 days to listen to.\nSubscription music services are appealing to me because of how much music I listen to music. Even if I’m not super into an album I like being to able to listen to whatever I’d like to without dropping $10 just to here a record. I like to hear what aritsts are doing as well as keep on the production styles artists are employing. Using services like Spotify, Rdio, or Mog this is (mostly) possible. This has led to a battle in my mind about how I will manage my music moving forward.\nCurrently, the majority of my music consumption takes place in iTunes. I use iTunes Match and my library is available to me on any of our computers or phones. However iTunes Match is far from the perfect cloud music solution and its been buggy for me from the start. During this time I’ve used streaming services as a supplement to my iTunes library, rather than my main music service. This is mostly because I’ve been unable to make myself jump in head first with any of the services. Choosing access over ownership is an easy decision with video, and I’m a huge fan of netflix, but music has some barrier in my brain that makes me want to own my music.\nStill, I want to choose access over ownership. The next barrier I’ve been experiencing is that none of the streaming services are without irritating flaws.\nSpotify I know a ton of people using the service\nIt has a large catalog\nbut\nI hate the UI/UX\nI really hate the lack of a collection view\nIt forces you to use playlists as you’re sole version of organization\nThe mobile app is absolutely terrible, largely due to the fact playlists are the only organization used\nRdio I love the UI/UX\nThe desktop app is great\nThe iPhone app is great\nIt lets me actually organize a collection of music apart from playlists\nbut\nI can count on one hand the number of friends using the service, severely diminishing it’s social features\nThe audio quality isn’t very good\nThe catalog lacks some albums I love that are present on the other services\nMOG Best sound quality of the streaming services\nHuge catalog\nExcellent recommendation engine\nbut\nTerrible desktop player\nno library organization features on desktop\nnavigation in the iPhone app requires way too many taps\nAll things considered I enjoy the Rdio experience enough that I would make it my main music hub in a heartbeat if they improved the audio quality. Part of me wants to make the move anyway, but all the albums I own simply sound better in iTunes. I’ve been using MOG as a supplement for a while but their desktop player is severely lagging compared to the competition.\nThere’s really no conclusion to offer here. I continue to use iTunes while experimenting with different streaming services. The cloud aspect of the various services is far superior to iTunes match, but some of the nitpicks listed above can be frustrating. Its also nice to not have to worry about metadata and album art. Maybe someday my desire to break free of my desire for ownership and what I’d like to see in a streaming service will align.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2012/streaming-vs-itunes/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"streaming-music-services-vs-an-itunes-addiction\"\u003eStreaming Music Services VS an iTunes Addiction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic has been a huge part of my life for many years.

Starting college was the main catalyst. At first I had a spiral notebook for each class and I would write any assignments at the top of a page in there. When it came time to complete work I would search through the notebook until I found the proper list. It was unorganized and it didn\u0026rsquo;t scale well. I then tried a few different task management apps on my iPhone, starting with Wunderlist and Appigo ToDo. Wunderlist was free and synced to a desktop counterpart. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t very flexible though. Since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow nested tasks I simply had a bulk school list when I really wanted to separate each class into its own list. I then tried Appigo ToDo which worked pretty well. It didn\u0026rsquo;t have a desktop app at the time though and only worked with iCal and Toodledo.com. Neither of those solutions really fit me and my needs.\nAs a bit of a Mac nerd I had heard different bloggers and tech pundits constantly praising Omnifocus. I also saw a few friends start using it. By all accounts it was a powerful program, but it was also expensive. Eventually I got a killer discount through school on the desktop app and gave it a go. Shawn Blanc has called Omnifocus a sledgehammer and he wasn\u0026rsquo;t kidding. It\u0026rsquo;s almost a full project management suite for your life. This comes with the expense of being complicated with a steeper learning curve. I was only really using it for school and wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what I was doing. The iPhone app was much easier to use but I still felt a little lost. It seemed that learning Omnifocus was a huge project in and of itself.\nOver time I have started to get the hang of it though and I\u0026rsquo;m beginning to rely on it for more than school. My wife and I have a 2 year old and newborn twins, I\u0026rsquo;m a full time college student, and I work part time. To put it mildly, the responsibilities in my life have become a bit overwhelming. I\u0026rsquo;m realizing that even if I don\u0026rsquo;t follow the GTD system to the tee, I need something to dump all these responsiblities into that will help me keep track of what I need to get done. In that spirit, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to immediatley dump things into Omnifocus and teaching myself to use it more throughout the day to decide on what to do. I\u0026rsquo;m slowly getting a handle on the desktop app and its nice to feel more organized. Now if only Omnifocus could create more hours in a day for me!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2012/managing-my-crazy-life-with-a-sledgehammer/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI started using task management software slowly as the need to keep track of things began increasing in life.  Starting college was the main catalyst.  At first I had a spiral notebook for each class and I would write any assignments at the top of a page in there.  When it came time to complete work I would search through the notebook until I found the proper list.  It was unorganized and it didn\u0026rsquo;t scale well.  \u003c/p\u003e","title":"Managing my crazy Life with a Sledgehammer"},{"content":"The best take I\u0026rsquo;ve read on Obama\u0026rsquo;s comments in support of gay marriage.\nPresident Obama’s Evolving Views\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2012/president-obamas-evolving-views/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe best take I\u0026rsquo;ve read on Obama\u0026rsquo;s comments in support of gay marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.loveisanorientation.com/2012/president-obamas-evolving-views/\"\u003ePresident Obama’s Evolving Views\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"President Obama’s Evolving Views"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ll be playing bass for Ok Sweetheart.

Squaretrade responded less than 12 hours later to request pictures. It is difficult to capture with a camera, but I did the best I could. I emailed Squaretrade these pictures at 9pm. The next morning I already had a response in my inbox saying my claim was approved and they would be overnighting a (refurbished) replacement phone. It was an incredibly easy process and Squaretrade was a pleasure to deal with. I also did not have to pay any form of deductible since it wasn\u0026rsquo;t considered accidental damage (i.e. cracked screen, phone in toilet).\nThe new phone arrived this morning and gave me a chance to restore form my iCloud backups for the first time. This new process is pretty user friendly. When I turned not the phone it requested my apple id and password and let me restore from the backup immediately with no iTunes required. The restore process was just as fast as plugging into the computer. Once the phone was done and restored however things got a little funky. All my apps showed up and looked like they were downloading.\nSo far it was an incredibly simple process. But then a dialog box popped up saying my password was incorrect and displaying someone else\u0026rsquo;s apple id? I changed the apple id to the one I had already entered and then received an error saying my apps could not be restored and that I need to plug into iTunes finish downloading them. Sure enough as soon as I plunged in my phone iTunes starting downloading the apps. It was still a strange bug though, and a bit of a security concern that some random persons apple id popped up on my phone. Overall iCloud has been great, and restoring from a backup is simple, but there are still some bugs to be ironed out. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a completely \u0026ldquo;PC free\u0026rdquo; experience in my case.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/squaretrade-iphone-4-replacement-and-icloud/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA couple weeks ago my iPhone developed a permanent vertical line down the right side of the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvn6yvpwtQ1qbk10k.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a Squaretrade extended warranty on the phone so I filed a claim.\nSquaretrade responded less than 12 hours later to request pictures.  It is\ndifficult to capture with a camera, but I did the best I could.  I emailed\nSquaretrade these pictures at 9pm.  The next morning I already had a response in\nmy inbox saying my claim was approved and they would be overnighting a\n(refurbished) replacement phone.  It was an incredibly easy process and\nSquaretrade was a pleasure to deal with.  I also did not have to pay any form of\ndeductible since it wasn\u0026rsquo;t considered accidental damage (i.e. cracked screen,\nphone in toilet).\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Squaretrade Iphone 4 replacement and iCloud restore"},{"content":"Home of the free?

I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep using iCloud for contacts and calendars. Google sync makes a mess of contacts, iCloud \u0026ldquo;just works.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll keep using Gmail for my main email. I\u0026rsquo;ll access it through Apple Mail on the desktop and the iPhone\u0026rsquo;s built in mail app.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how I set it up to avoid duplicate messages and other craziness. Log into Gmail\u0026rsquo;s settings and navigate to the labels tab. Here you can control which labels show up in IMAP. What I did was hide all mail, starred, and important from IMAP. If I\u0026rsquo;m going to archive a message I throw it into a folder in Mail. I also created an archive folder for any mail I want to keep that doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit into a specific folder. In Lion, Mail now has an archive and delete button. Hitting the archive button moves the message to this archive folder, while hitting delete actually deletes the message. If you need to access Gmail through the web app you still have all of your mail available to search in all mail and the new archive label. I like this setup better because I have complete control over whether a message is deleted or archived via Mail\u0026rsquo;s native interface.\nProblem solved (minus push on iPhone).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/make-gmail-play-nice-with-apple-mail/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYesterday I determined a compromise.  I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep using iCloud for\ncontacts and calendars.  Google sync makes a mess of contacts, iCloud \u0026ldquo;just\nworks.\u0026rdquo;  I\u0026rsquo;ll keep using Gmail for my main email.  I\u0026rsquo;ll access it through Apple\nMail on the desktop and the iPhone\u0026rsquo;s built in mail app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s how I set it up to avoid duplicate messages and other craziness.  Log\ninto Gmail\u0026rsquo;s settings and navigate to the labels tab.  Here you can control\nwhich labels show up in IMAP.  What I did was hide all mail, starred, and\nimportant from IMAP.  \u003c/p\u003e","title":"Make Gmail play nice with Apple Mail"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve used Gmail or several years and have really enjoyed the experience. It\u0026rsquo;s not without its quirks however. Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP client can attest to how wonky things can get. The way Gmail\u0026rsquo;s All Mail folder functions causes lots of duplicate messages to show up. If a message has a label it will appear in both a folder for that label as well as in the All Mail folder. If you search for a message in the client multiple copies will pop up. The Gmail experience on the iPhone is also annoying. You can setup up Gmail through IMAP just like a desktop client, with all of the duplicate messages, but you can\u0026rsquo;t get push. That means I have to set my phone to poll the network at a certain interval. This is bad for battery life at high settings and means that messages don\u0026rsquo;t show up right away. The other option is to set up Gmail though Google sync as an exchange server. You can get push with this option but deleting a message will always archive it. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to archive all the junk newsletter messages I get. To delete a message with this setup I have to select it and then manually move it to Gmail\u0026rsquo;s trash folder.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also used Google sync to keep my contacts and calendars in sync between all my devices. This also has some annoying limitations, particularly for contacts. The different fields you can sync for each contact are very limited. Google will also take any contact pictures you sync and turn them into a grainy thumbnail. Calendar syncing, for me at least, has usually worked fine.\nEnter iCloud. It is an Apple service designed to be integrated with their products. Great! I immediately switched to iCloud for the syncing of my contacts and calendars. Contacts syncing is much more seamless than it was with Gmail, with much less setup and maintenance required. Calendars worked equally as well. I also signed up for an iCloud mail account back during the beta period but never used it. I was considering making the switch to that as well. When iOS 5 was released I became a little uneasy about this move. Apple\u0026rsquo;s servers buckled under all the initial sign up traffic and mail was down for several hours. That was already more downtime than I\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced with Gmail. I kept thinking about how nice complete integration would be though. Finally I decided to go for it. Using Apple Mail I moved all of my messages from Gmail into iCloud. That first night I was happy with the move. The next day I had to pull up an email to print something at work. Like most stupid IT departments Starbucks locks down their computers to only using Internet Explorer. When I tried to pull up iCloud.com to get the message it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t load. Apple doesn\u0026rsquo;t support Internet Explorer, and the site won\u0026rsquo;t even load. Then I got home and tried to send an email to someone on our worship team, but kept getting an error. Turns out that the SMTP server was down. Down again! It was that experience that prompted my \u0026ldquo;screw this, back to Gmail\u0026rdquo; tweet. . Simply put, email should be reliable. iCloud also uses a custom authentication method and I can\u0026rsquo;t get it work with Sparrow mail at the moment. Not only that, I logged into iCloud.com today and realized that the web client doesn\u0026rsquo;t have threaded messaging! Apple mail and the iPhone have had threaded conversations for quite some time, and so did Mobile Me. These products don\u0026rsquo;t just simply work, and aren\u0026rsquo;t all that unified in their experience, which is very un-Apple.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still not sure what I\u0026rsquo;ll do. I like iCloud contact syncing much better, but if I\u0026rsquo;m using Gmail it makes sense to keep my contacts synced there. I like using a mail client as well. Sparrow integrates with all of Gmail\u0026rsquo;s features like labels natively, but I\u0026rsquo;m favoring Apple Mail these days. On my iPhone I can use another app like Boxcar to get push notifications and then pull up the Gmail site in mobile safari. That still isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal though. I want my email to work seamlessly with my iPhone since it is what I use for probably 75% of my email, and as good as the Gmail mobile web app, is its still not as smooth as a native application. Hopefully iCloud will get more reliable and gain some features over time, but right now I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in undecided mode.\nHas anyone had better luck than me?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/gmail-to-icloud-to-gmail-again/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve used Gmail or several years and have really enjoyed the experience.  It\u0026rsquo;s\nnot without its quirks however.  Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP\nclient can attest to how wonky things can get.  The way Gmail\u0026rsquo;s All Mail folder\nfunctions causes lots of duplicate messages to show up.  If a message has a\nlabel it will appear in both a folder for that label as well as in the All Mail\nfolder.  If you search for a message in the client multiple copies will pop up.\nThe Gmail experience on the iPhone is also annoying.  You can setup up Gmail\nthrough IMAP just like a desktop client, with all of the duplicate messages, but\nyou can\u0026rsquo;t get push.  That means I have to set my phone to poll the network at a\ncertain interval.  This is bad for battery life at high settings and means that\nmessages don\u0026rsquo;t show up right away.  The other option is to set up Gmail though\nGoogle sync as an exchange server.  You can get push with this option but\ndeleting a message will always archive it.  I don\u0026rsquo;t want to archive all the junk\nnewsletter messages I get.  To delete a message with this setup I have to select\nit and then manually move it to Gmail\u0026rsquo;s trash folder.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Gmail to iCloud to Gmail again..."},{"content":"We got to see the twins again today.

Tributes to Steve are all over the internet right now, and rightly so, but I think there is a greater tragedy in his death that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been picked up on. I was reading a post about the biography of Steve Jobs where the author was talking about why Steve had decided to be so open with him after such a history of keeping things close to the chest. Here is Steve\u0026rsquo;s response.\n“I wanted my kids to know me,” he said. “I wasn’t always there for them, and I wanted them to know why and to understand what I did.”\nFor a man to accomplish so much, running a company in such a hands on way other areas of life had to budge. Think about all the time Steve spent working, and then think about that time subtracted from his children. That is a sacrifice he made to create what he did.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to read to much into this quote and assume things. So I will stop here, and simply say that I think this is representative of a sad pattern in our country today. The pattern that parents leave most of the parenting of their children up to their daily caretakers. Our kids need us.

Later I started going to the same Church he did. I spent a couple years playing guitar on the worship team while he played drums. Later he would join Memphis Belle (unfortunately near the bands end) and we would tour the country together. Randy is extremely creative and talented and I have the utmost respect for him. When I moved to Chicago we jammed by email with a few dirty garage songs. Later he recorded A Worthy Chronicle and asked me to mix it. I had spent several months interning for a major recording studio and spent time around some truly great engineers. I had not, however, ever fully mixed anything myself besides messing around at the studio. It was no brainer for me to tackle mixing these songs. Right after I started Tif and I had Mylin. It turns out learning effective time management while raising a child, attending school full time, and playing in a band isn\u0026rsquo;t so easy. Randy was VERY gracious with the fact that it took me over a year to complete. It was a lot of fun and some great practice. If I were to tackle this project now it would probably only take me a few weeks to complete, at most. I really like the personality of these songs. Do me a favor and give the record a download. You can name your own price on his bandcamp page or stream it directly. http://randallscott.bandcamp.com\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/a-worthy-chronicle-by-randy-baranosky/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI first met Randy during a spanish class in my freshmen year of high school.\nLater I started going to the same Church he did.  I spent a couple years playing\nguitar on the worship team while he played drums.  Later he would join Memphis\nBelle (unfortunately near the bands end) and we would tour the country together.\nRandy is extremely creative and talented and I have the utmost respect for him. \u003c/p\u003e","title":"A Worthy Chronicle by Randy Baranosky"},{"content":"\nI love my city.
