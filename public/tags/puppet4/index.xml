      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re working to upgrade our infrastructure to Puppet 4 and are making use of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/catalog_preview#migrate4_empty_string_true&#34;&gt;catalog preview tool&lt;/a&gt; to help identify code that needs to be updated. The preview tool in and of itself is handy, but the output it produces can be a bit daunting. During the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/PuppetLabs/puppetconf-2016-getting-to-the-latest-puppet-nate-mccurdy-elizabeth-wittig-plumb-puppet&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Getting to the Latest Puppet&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; talk at puppetconf they pointed out a tool that professional services uses to create a nice html version of the output. Naturally I got excited to use this, but discovered it doesn&amp;rsquo;t properly work with open source Puppet due to some hardcoded Puppet Enterprise paths. Fortunately it was only 3 lines to update! My fork is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dschaaff/prosvc-preview_report&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;Â if its useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
