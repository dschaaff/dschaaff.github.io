      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last 4 weeks have been a blur.  I took on extra course in order to finish school at the end of this month.  And by finish, I mean graduate!!  My brain is tired all the time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working overtime on school, but its the first time I can feel the end being near.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September=freedom.  And hopefully a job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It turns out my wife is a fantastic writer.  She has written an excellent, entertaining, and thorough run down of what an average day for us looks like.  Raising a 2 year old while managing newborn twins is pretty hectic and challenging.  Its sometimes surprising that we&amp;rsquo;re surviving all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We got to go see the twins again today.  It is amazing how much they are already moving around.  I could see their little arms and legs now!  The little tikes are healthy and everything is going well.  We were happy to hear that they each have their own placenta and sac, which is the most optimal condition for twins!  In the upper left hand corner of each picture is an A or a B.  A is one twin and B is the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
