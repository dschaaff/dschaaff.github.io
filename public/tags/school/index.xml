      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last 4 weeks have been a blur.  I took on extra course in order to finish school at the end of this month.  And by finish, I mean graduate!!  My brain is tired all the time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working overtime on school, but its the first time I can feel the end being near.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September=freedom.  And hopefully a job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started using task management software slowly as the need to keep track of things began increasing in life.  Starting college was the main catalyst.  At first I had a spiral notebook for each class and I would write any assignments at the top of a page in there.  When it came time to complete work I would search through the notebook until I found the proper list.  It was unorganized and it didn&amp;rsquo;t scale well.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>
