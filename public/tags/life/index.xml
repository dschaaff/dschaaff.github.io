      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;taking-the-first-step-into-our-fears&#34;&gt;Taking the first step into our fears&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching my children continues to teach me valuable lessons. The big decisions in life are tough and we often put off making a decision as long as possible due to fear and anxiety. This leads to procrastination and can be crippling at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about this while interacting with my oldest daughter at the waterpark a few weekends ago. In the kids pool area there were 3 waterslides.  She would happily slide down the smaller two but steadfastly refuse the &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; larger slide.  My one and a half year old twins even rode the larger slide but that did little to sway the strong willed 3 year old. In her mind it was a gargantuan waterfall.  On the second day there I continued to plead with her to take plunge.  It would be so much fun I assured her but she couldn&amp;rsquo;t look past her fear.  As a last ditch effort I offered a treat in return for trying the slide.  Her expression immediately perked up at the sound of that magical word and she ran straight to the top of the slide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last 4 weeks have been a blur.  I took on extra course in order to finish school at the end of this month.  And by finish, I mean graduate!!  My brain is tired all the time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working overtime on school, but its the first time I can feel the end being near.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September=freedom.  And hopefully a job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It turns out my wife is a fantastic writer.  She has written an excellent, entertaining, and thorough run down of what an average day for us looks like.  Raising a 2 year old while managing newborn twins is pretty hectic and challenging.  Its sometimes surprising that we&amp;rsquo;re surviving all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Managing my crazy Life with a Sledgehammer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started using task management software slowly as the need to keep track of things began increasing in life.  Starting college was the main catalyst.  At first I had a spiral notebook for each class and I would write any assignments at the top of a page in there.  When it came time to complete work I would search through the notebook until I found the proper list.  It was unorganized and it didn&amp;rsquo;t scale well.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Would it even be worth it if you could go back and change the past?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tif and I have had a lot of conversations about whether we would change the past.  I always would say that are things I would absolutely like to change.  That&amp;rsquo;s where I naturally go with regret.  Tif didn&amp;rsquo;t think you could divorce what has happened in the past with who we are today and in a lot of ways I&amp;rsquo;ve come to agree with her.  Good or bad, where we are is a direct result of where we&amp;rsquo;ve been.  I had to learn to not dwell on things that had happened, but instead focus on where I was and where I was heading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
