      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m learning ruby. Finding time to work towards this goal is proving difficult but I&amp;rsquo;m forcing myself to use ruby wherever possible to aid in my learning. I&amp;rsquo;ll be putting some of my lame code on here to chronicle my learning and &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt; get some feedback on how I can improve things. I recently came across a good opportunity when I needed to generate a list of nodes to use with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-catalog_preview&#34;&gt;puppet catalog preview tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve poked a lot of fun at chatops but I have found some value in portions of the practice. Let me state upfront that I do not believe paying attention to the chat room all day and having your attention interrupted non-stop is a productive or healthy practice. I have found some big benefits to &amp;ldquo;chatops&amp;rdquo; however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visibility&#34;&gt;Visibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work that is done in the chatroom, or filtered into the chatroom, is visible to the whole team. This helps the team be aware of what others are doing and stay up to date. I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up on quite a few things from this that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have learned other wise. This is also why we choose to route a fair amount of notifications into chat. For example we have Jira connected to HipChat and it makes it really easy to stay on top of issues. We also push commit notifications, build notifications, etc in the chatroom. The downside to this is that the rooms get noisy and make it harder to follow actual conversations between humans. One strategy we use to combat that is creating multiple rooms and focusing them around a subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
