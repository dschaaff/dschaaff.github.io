      <title>Jenkins Dynamic EC2 Executors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a nice plugin for Jenkins that lets you dynamically add capacity by spinning up EC2 instances on demand and then terminating them when the job queue expires. This is a great way to save money on an AWS based build infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the plugin documentation is really light and there are a few gotchas to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;security-groups&#34;&gt;Security Groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This field only accepts comma separated security group IDs, not names. This is frustrating because other fields in the plugin take a space separated list (e.g. labels)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sure enough Gmail is live in the app store.  Unfortunately its not an entirely
native application.  Most of it is a native wrapper for a web view of the mobile
site.  We get push notifications(except that their broken right now), address
book integration, and the ability to attach photos, but the interface is a bit
laggy and still won&amp;rsquo;t format an html email to fit the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised.  Google usually releases products publicly before they&amp;rsquo;re ready and then slowly improves them.  Link to the app store below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Make Gmail play nice with Apple Mail</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/make-gmail-play-nice-with-apple-mail/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I determined a compromise.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep using iCloud for
contacts and calendars.  Google sync makes a mess of contacts, iCloud &amp;ldquo;just
works.&amp;rdquo;  I&amp;rsquo;ll keep using Gmail for my main email.  I&amp;rsquo;ll access it through Apple
Mail on the desktop and the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s built in mail app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I set it up to avoid duplicate messages and other craziness.  Log
into Gmail&amp;rsquo;s settings and navigate to the labels tab.  Here you can control
which labels show up in IMAP.  What I did was hide all mail, starred, and
important from IMAP.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gmail to iCloud to Gmail again...</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/gmail-to-icloud-to-gmail-again/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Gmail or several years and have really enjoyed the experience.  It&amp;rsquo;s
not without its quirks however.  Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP
client can attest to how wonky things can get.  The way Gmail&amp;rsquo;s All Mail folder
functions causes lots of duplicate messages to show up.  If a message has a
label it will appear in both a folder for that label as well as in the All Mail
folder.  If you search for a message in the client multiple copies will pop up.
The Gmail experience on the iPhone is also annoying.  You can setup up Gmail
through IMAP just like a desktop client, with all of the duplicate messages, but
you can&amp;rsquo;t get push.  That means I have to set my phone to poll the network at a
certain interval.  This is bad for battery life at high settings and means that
messages don&amp;rsquo;t show up right away.  The other option is to set up Gmail though
Google sync as an exchange server.  You can get push with this option but
deleting a message will always archive it.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to archive all the junk
newsletter messages I get.  To delete a message with this setup I have to select
it and then manually move it to Gmail&amp;rsquo;s trash folder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Facebook Messenger</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/facebook-messenger/</link>

&lt;p&gt;As much a I am prone to whine about Facebook, I really like
the Facebook messenger app.  Now that I&amp;rsquo;m on iOS 5 I&amp;rsquo;m already seeing some
benefit from using iMessage.  Mostly that its much faster at sending than
standard text messages.  Facebook messengers offers more though.  It presents a
unified communication stream between all devices.  If I&amp;rsquo;m texting someone
through Facebook messenger that conversation is present when I hop onto my
computer.  I can pick up right where I left off.  Maybe iMessage will get mac
integration at some point, but it will never be as cross platform as Facebook.
BUT, it is still Facebook I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.  Yuck.  Google+ has the potential
to offer a similar system in the future, but right now its still a ghost town.
Have you tried the facebook messenger app?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Different Tragedy in Steve Jobs&#39; Death</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love Apple and the products they create.  I always had an interest in gadgets
but was too busy playing guitar and trying to keep an old Dell laptop working to
take it much further than that.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I moved to Chicago and bought
my first Macbook Pro that I fell in love technology. There is something in the
design of Apple products that makes them a pleasure to use, and that is thanks
to the vision and genius of Steve Jobs.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>
