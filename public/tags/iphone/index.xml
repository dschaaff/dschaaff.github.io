&lt;p&gt;This morning I discovered my jacket pocket will not hold my phone while I run around with the kids. The apple case didn&amp;rsquo;t help at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>iOS Music Players</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pro tip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the desktop we’re mostly limited to using iTunes for music playback (aside from streaming services). If you don’t like iTunes, good luck finding a better alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the situation is different on an iOS device. Don’t like apple’s music app? Simply fire up the AppStore and download a 3rd party music player. I recommend checking out &lt;a href=&#34;http://ecouteapp.com/ecouteios/&#34;&gt;Ecoute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://enderlabs.com/track-8&#34;&gt;Track 8&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zikeragroove.com/&#34;&gt;Groove 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;streaming-music-services-vs-an-itunes-addiction&#34;&gt;Streaming Music Services VS an iTunes Addiction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music has been a huge part of my life for many years. I’m no longer a touring musician but I still play music as much as I can. Music is always playing in our house and I can’t imagine living life without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time has changed the way I listen to music a lot. I came of age in the era of the CD, but ever since I got my first iPod I’ve relied almost entirely on iTunes for my music consumption. At this point I’ve amassed a collection that would take 43 days to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>iOS 6.0.1 Battery Life</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2012/ios-601-battery-life/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My battery life has been absolutely terrible ever since I updated my iPhone 5 to iOS 6.0.1.  Tonight I discovered it was because the brightness setting was set to the maximum after  the update.  Thinking this might&amp;rsquo;ve been some sort of fluke I checked my wife&amp;rsquo;s iPhone 4.  Sure enough the brightness setting was maxed on hers too.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve been having battery issues since the update you might want to double check this setting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I too have been fiddling around with Bing for the past few weeks and have found it surprisingly good experience.  The results seem just as good as Google&amp;rsquo;s and they look a lot more attractive and clutter free on the iPhone.  Though oddly enough the desktop results seem a lot more cluttered on Bing than Google.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Today my iPhone&#39;s back glass shattered</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2012/today-my-iphones-back-glass-shattered/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2012 02:16:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2012/today-my-iphones-back-glass-shattered/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It did this without me dropping it.  It was in my pocket and in an Incipio
Feather case.  I pulled it out to find it shattered all around the camera.
Thankfully a few minutes at the Apple store and $29 later it was sporting a
brand new back.  As I thought about it on the train home it started to make more
sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squaretrade sent me a refurbished replacement for my defective iPhone 4 a few
months back.  I was positive that their replacement used 3rd party glass for the
front and the back.  There was no oleophobic coating and fingerprints were
extremely difficult to wipe off.  Something also felt different about the glass.
I put an oleophobic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenonionssupply.com/kindle-accessories/kindle-fire-crystal-anti-fingerprint-screen-protector.html&#34;&gt;screen
protector&lt;/a&gt;
on the font.  It scratches a  lot more easily than the glass but it also only
takes a swipe of the shirt to clean.  There was no such solution for the back.
Now that I have a true Apple back again, I realize what a big difference there
e is.  I really think the glass shattered because it was cheap knock off
replacement part used by Squaretrade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Squaretrade Iphone 4 replacement and iCloud restore</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/squaretrade-iphone-4-replacement-and-icloud/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago my iPhone developed a permanent vertical line down the right side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvn6yvpwtQ1qbk10k.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Squaretrade extended warranty on the phone so I filed a claim.
Squaretrade responded less than 12 hours later to request pictures.  It is
difficult to capture with a camera, but I did the best I could.  I emailed
Squaretrade these pictures at 9pm.  The next morning I already had a response in
my inbox saying my claim was approved and they would be overnighting a
(refurbished) replacement phone.  It was an incredibly easy process and
Squaretrade was a pleasure to deal with.  I also did not have to pay any form of
deductible since it wasn&amp;rsquo;t considered accidental damage (i.e. cracked screen,
phone in toilet).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>google sure loves to disappoint</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sure enough Gmail is live in the app store.  Unfortunately its not an entirely
native application.  Most of it is a native wrapper for a web view of the mobile
site.  We get push notifications(except that their broken right now), address
book integration, and the ability to attach photos, but the interface is a bit
laggy and still won&amp;rsquo;t format an html email to fit the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised.  Google usually releases products publicly before they&amp;rsquo;re ready and then slowly improves them.  Link to the app store below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Make Gmail play nice with Apple Mail</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/make-gmail-play-nice-with-apple-mail/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I determined a compromise.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep using iCloud for
contacts and calendars.  Google sync makes a mess of contacts, iCloud &amp;ldquo;just
works.&amp;rdquo;  I&amp;rsquo;ll keep using Gmail for my main email.  I&amp;rsquo;ll access it through Apple
Mail on the desktop and the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s built in mail app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I set it up to avoid duplicate messages and other craziness.  Log
into Gmail&amp;rsquo;s settings and navigate to the labels tab.  Here you can control
which labels show up in IMAP.  What I did was hide all mail, starred, and
important from IMAP.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gmail to iCloud to Gmail again...</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/gmail-to-icloud-to-gmail-again/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Gmail or several years and have really enjoyed the experience.  It&amp;rsquo;s
not without its quirks however.  Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP
client can attest to how wonky things can get.  The way Gmail&amp;rsquo;s All Mail folder
functions causes lots of duplicate messages to show up.  If a message has a
label it will appear in both a folder for that label as well as in the All Mail
folder.  If you search for a message in the client multiple copies will pop up.
The Gmail experience on the iPhone is also annoying.  You can setup up Gmail
through IMAP just like a desktop client, with all of the duplicate messages, but
you can&amp;rsquo;t get push.  That means I have to set my phone to poll the network at a
certain interval.  This is bad for battery life at high settings and means that
messages don&amp;rsquo;t show up right away.  The other option is to set up Gmail though
Google sync as an exchange server.  You can get push with this option but
deleting a message will always archive it.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to archive all the junk
newsletter messages I get.  To delete a message with this setup I have to select
it and then manually move it to Gmail&amp;rsquo;s trash folder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sync your Twitter timeline with Tweetmarker</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/sync-your-twitter-timeline-with-tweetmarker/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I used Echofon as my main twitter app.  It was ugly as sin but
it would sync my unread status between my iPhone and my mac.  Eventually I fell
in love with Tweetbot too much to keep using Echofon.  I always missed the
syncing though and I usually avoided using Twitter on my mac because I hated
having to scroll to find where I left off, not to mention it telling me all of
my direct messages were unread.  Thankfully a developer named Manton Reece
created the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tweetmarker.net/&#34;&gt;Tweetmarker&lt;/a&gt; service.  This is an open
service that can be implemented by any Twitter app and will sync your timeline
position between multiple apps.  Now, when I open Twitterific on my mac it
automatically scrolls the last tweet I read in Tweetbot on my iPhone.  Simply
put, I love it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
