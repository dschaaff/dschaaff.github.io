      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The biggest myth we are fed as artists is that we need to sustain ourselves solely on our art. This is ridiculous. Every artist has at some point in time had some other job.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Children explore. Adults follow paths. Adults are content to walk the same way, hundreds of times, or thousands; perhaps it never occurs to adults to step off the paths, to creep beneath rhododendrons, to find the spaces between fences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Giving Away Music Makes Sense</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A really good take on &lt;a href=&#34;http://derekwebb.tumblr.com/post/13503899950/giving-it-away-how-free-music-makes-more-than-sense&#34;&gt;the state of the music business&lt;/a&gt; as it relates to Spotify, piracy, iTunes, and money from Derek Webb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll go even further to say that I actually prefer illegal downloading over Spotify because when you get music illegally it’s at least implicit in the transaction that what you’re doing is potentially harmful to the artist.  But with Spotify, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_19361137&#34;&gt;your conscience is clear&lt;/a&gt; because you’re either enduring ads or paying to use the service and access the music.  But from the blue-collar artist’s perspective, they’re not receiving any meaningful payment (there’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://matthewebel.com/2011/07/20/spotify-let-the-money-pour-in/&#34;&gt;little discernible difference&lt;/a&gt; between $0.00029 and $0.00) and they are learning nothing about their fans, not to mention that music readily available on Spotify for little to no payment &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2011/11/distributor-pulls-234-labels-from-spotify-napster-rdio-after-itunes-payments-drop-24.html&#34;&gt;completely poaches the record sales&lt;/a&gt; upon which middle-class musicians are depending for survival (which is why I will withhold any new releases from Spotify in the future).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of separation as a tool is the antithesis of rock and roll, which is a bunch of guys in a room making a sound and just capturing it.  It&amp;rsquo;s the sound they make together, not separated.  This mythical bullshit about stereo and high tech and Dolby, it&amp;rsquo;s just totally against the whole grain of what music should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
