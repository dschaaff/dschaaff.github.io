      <description>&lt;p&gt;I too have been fiddling around with Bing for the past few weeks and have found it surprisingly good experience.  The results seem just as good as Google&amp;rsquo;s and they look a lot more attractive and clutter free on the iPhone.  Though oddly enough the desktop results seem a lot more cluttered on Bing than Google.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Be careful what you search for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason to use duckduckgo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Make Gmail play nice with Apple Mail</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/make-gmail-play-nice-with-apple-mail/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I determined a compromise.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep using iCloud for
contacts and calendars.  Google sync makes a mess of contacts, iCloud &amp;ldquo;just
works.&amp;rdquo;  I&amp;rsquo;ll keep using Gmail for my main email.  I&amp;rsquo;ll access it through Apple
Mail on the desktop and the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s built in mail app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I set it up to avoid duplicate messages and other craziness.  Log
into Gmail&amp;rsquo;s settings and navigate to the labels tab.  Here you can control
which labels show up in IMAP.  What I did was hide all mail, starred, and
important from IMAP.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Gmail or several years and have really enjoyed the experience.  It&amp;rsquo;s
not without its quirks however.  Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP
client can attest to how wonky things can get.  The way Gmail&amp;rsquo;s All Mail folder
functions causes lots of duplicate messages to show up.  If a message has a
label it will appear in both a folder for that label as well as in the All Mail
folder.  If you search for a message in the client multiple copies will pop up.
The Gmail experience on the iPhone is also annoying.  You can setup up Gmail
through IMAP just like a desktop client, with all of the duplicate messages, but
you can&amp;rsquo;t get push.  That means I have to set my phone to poll the network at a
certain interval.  This is bad for battery life at high settings and means that
messages don&amp;rsquo;t show up right away.  The other option is to set up Gmail though
Google sync as an exchange server.  You can get push with this option but
deleting a message will always archive it.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to archive all the junk
newsletter messages I get.  To delete a message with this setup I have to select
it and then manually move it to Gmail&amp;rsquo;s trash folder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
