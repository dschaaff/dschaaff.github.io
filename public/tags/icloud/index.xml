      <title>Update on iCloud&#43; Custom Email Domain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my custom domain with iCloud email for a couple weeks. Truth be
told I hardly notice any difference from when I used Gmail. That&amp;rsquo;s largely due
to using Apple Mail app as my primary interface. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any reliability
issues and the only real difference I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is the email size limit is
20MB as opposed to Gmail&amp;rsquo;s 25MB. The primary benefit I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is that
calendar invites end up on my iCloud calendar, which is where I prefer them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Migrating My Email From Google Workspace To iCloud&#43;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of migrating my email from Google Workspace to iCloud+. I&amp;rsquo;ve
been using Google Workspace (aka gsuite, aka whatever name Google switches to
next week) for my email for a long time. For ages it was free and made perfect
sense as a service. Those free accounts have gone away, and the service&amp;rsquo;s focus
is clearly aimed at the enterprise and not individuals like me. The price per
user is also about to increase on me, so this felt like a good time to try
something else. I&amp;rsquo;m only really interested in hosting email for a few custom
domains and have no needs for any features beyond that. Our family already uses
iCloud for everything so I figured why not give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Squaretrade Iphone 4 replacement and iCloud restore</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago my iPhone developed a permanent vertical line down the right side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvn6yvpwtQ1qbk10k.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Squaretrade extended warranty on the phone so I filed a claim.
Squaretrade responded less than 12 hours later to request pictures.  It is
difficult to capture with a camera, but I did the best I could.  I emailed
Squaretrade these pictures at 9pm.  The next morning I already had a response in
my inbox saying my claim was approved and they would be overnighting a
(refurbished) replacement phone.  It was an incredibly easy process and
Squaretrade was a pleasure to deal with.  I also did not have to pay any form of
deductible since it wasn&amp;rsquo;t considered accidental damage (i.e. cracked screen,
phone in toilet).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Make Gmail play nice with Apple Mail</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/make-gmail-play-nice-with-apple-mail/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I determined a compromise.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep using iCloud for
contacts and calendars.  Google sync makes a mess of contacts, iCloud &amp;ldquo;just
works.&amp;rdquo;  I&amp;rsquo;ll keep using Gmail for my main email.  I&amp;rsquo;ll access it through Apple
Mail on the desktop and the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s built in mail app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I set it up to avoid duplicate messages and other craziness.  Log
into Gmail&amp;rsquo;s settings and navigate to the labels tab.  Here you can control
which labels show up in IMAP.  What I did was hide all mail, starred, and
important from IMAP.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gmail to iCloud to Gmail again...</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/gmail-to-icloud-to-gmail-again/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Gmail or several years and have really enjoyed the experience.  It&amp;rsquo;s
not without its quirks however.  Anyone who has ever used Gmail with an IMAP
client can attest to how wonky things can get.  The way Gmail&amp;rsquo;s All Mail folder
functions causes lots of duplicate messages to show up.  If a message has a
label it will appear in both a folder for that label as well as in the All Mail
folder.  If you search for a message in the client multiple copies will pop up.
The Gmail experience on the iPhone is also annoying.  You can setup up Gmail
through IMAP just like a desktop client, with all of the duplicate messages, but
you can&amp;rsquo;t get push.  That means I have to set my phone to poll the network at a
certain interval.  This is bad for battery life at high settings and means that
messages don&amp;rsquo;t show up right away.  The other option is to set up Gmail though
Google sync as an exchange server.  You can get push with this option but
deleting a message will always archive it.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to archive all the junk
newsletter messages I get.  To delete a message with this setup I have to select
it and then manually move it to Gmail&amp;rsquo;s trash folder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
