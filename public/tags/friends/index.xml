      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first met Randy during a spanish class in my freshmen year of high school.
Later I started going to the same Church he did.  I spent a couple years playing
guitar on the worship team while he played drums.  Later he would join Memphis
Belle (unfortunately near the bands end) and we would tour the country together.
Randy is extremely creative and talented and I have the utmost respect for him. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
