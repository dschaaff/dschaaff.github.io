title: Make Gmail play nice with Apple Mail

Yesterday I determined a compromise.  I'm going to keep using iCloud for
contacts and calendars.  Google sync makes a mess of contacts, iCloud "just
works."  I'll keep using Gmail for my main email.  I'll access it through Apple
Mail on the desktop and the iPhone's built in mail app.

Here's how I set it up to avoid duplicate messages and other craziness.  Log
into Gmail's settings and navigate to the labels tab.  Here you can control
which labels show up in IMAP.  What I did was hide all mail, starred, and
important from IMAP.  

If I'm going to archive a message I throw it into a folder in Mail.  I also
created an archive folder for any mail I want to keep that doesn't fit into a
specific folder.  In Lion, Mail now has an archive and delete button.  Hitting
the archive button moves the message to this archive folder, while hitting
delete actually deletes the message.  If you need to access Gmail through the
web app you still have all of your mail available to search in all mail and the
new archive label.  I like this setup better because I have complete control
over whether a message is deleted or archived via Mail's native interface.

Problem solved (minus push on iPhone).
