As much a I am prone to whine about Facebook, I really like the Facebook messenger app.  Now that I'm on iOS 5 I'm already seeing some benefit from using iMessage.  Mostly that its much faster at sending than standard text messages.  Facebook messengers offers more though.  It presents a unified communication stream between all devices.  If I'm texting someone through Facebook messenger that conversation is present when I hop onto my computer.  I can pick up right where I left off.  Maybe iMessage will get mac integration at some point, but it will never be as cross platform as Facebook.  BUT, it is still Facebook I'm talking about.  Yuck.  Google+ has the potential to offer a similar system in the future, but right now its still a ghost town.  Have you tried the facebook messenger app?
