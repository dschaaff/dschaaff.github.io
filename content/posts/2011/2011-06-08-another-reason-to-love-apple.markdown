 One of the biggest criticism I usually hear about Apple products are that they
 are too expensive.  Never mind that these criticisms don't understand total
 cost of ownership.  When OSX Lion is released in July it will only cost users
 $30.  There are two versions.  If you want OSX server you are only forking over
 $50 for a license.  Compare that to the cost of buying a Windows 7 box.  Not to
 mention that Microsoft releases several versions with different levels of
 features for different price points.  With Apple its simple.  Server, or
 regular version, and all features are included.
