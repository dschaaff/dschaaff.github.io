For years, I would run to a notebook everyday and write about anything and everything.  Somedays I would write lyrics/poems, and other days I would simply hash out what was going through my brain.  It was a great practice and it really meant a lot to me.  Journaling allowed me to sort out my emotions and beliefs.  It was also the most intimate time I ever had with my creator.  I also felt like God was there when I would write, more so than when I would pray (though journaling can definitely BE prayer).  In the past 4 years or so, however, I've maybe journaled a handful of times.  I keep meaning to get back to it, but put off.  Well today I'm back on the horse.  

I consider myself a tech nerd.  Rather than get distracted by technology, I'm trying to use it to focus on my goals.  Formally I would journal the old fashioned way, with pen and paper, but now I am going to use Evernote.  With it I can satisfy my desire to play with my gadgets while also accomplishing something that is important to me.  Winning!
