title: Keeping up with WTF happened today!
---

Keeping up with the news can be a double-edged sword. It's imported to stay
informed on what's happening in the world while maintaining my sanity. A doom
scrolling spiral isn't good for anyone. I've been enjoying getting short, daily
newsletters with a quick recap of the big stories. My favorite of these has
been Matt Kiser's ["What The Fuck Just Happened
Today?"](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/about/) newsletter. He
provides excellent concise summaries of things and keeps it light with the
current mood emoji reactions. It's worth a look.
