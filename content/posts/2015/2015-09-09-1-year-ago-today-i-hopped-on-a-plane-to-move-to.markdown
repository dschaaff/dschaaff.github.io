1 year ago today I hopped on a plane to move to San Diego. After having had enough with Chicago winters I started looking for work in sunny California. What was incredible is that only 3 weeks passed between putting my resume online and my first day at Intellisis. I left my wife and girls behind to pack up the apartment and move across the country. My saint of a wife somehow kept it together watching all 3 girls, working, packing up our lives, and finally driving across the country.





I'm happy to say I'm still thrilled with our decision today.
