> Most of you who’ve been reading Hermitology or following Thrice over the years are probably well aware of how much I admire Dave Grohl and how much I’ve been inspired by what he’s done and continues to do. [Marc Maron had Grohl as a guest on the WTF Podcast this week](http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/episode-353-dave-grohl) and the conversation they had boosted that admiration and inspiration to a whole new level. It’s an absolute must-listen. I could have listened to them chat for hours.

I just downloaded this podcast and plan to give it a listen later. I greatly admire Dave Grohl as a musician and often state that I think the Foo Fighters will go down as the Led Zeppelin of our generation.
