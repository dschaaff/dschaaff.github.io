<blockquote>What makes me content are small things…like getting a good nights sleep, or a good cup of coffee, or a great conversation, or really having a worshipful moment with the Lord, or high-fiving my two-year-old daughter.  When those things come around, it doesn’t matter what job I am doing, or where I live, or what my prospects for the future are.  God will take care of that stuff.</blockquote>
