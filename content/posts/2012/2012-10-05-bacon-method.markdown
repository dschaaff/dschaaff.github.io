# Sweet, Delicious Bacon




I came across Dan Benjamin’s recommendation for cooking bacon in the oven and have finally gotten around to trying it. It sparked my interest since it calls for starting with a cold oven. It turns that Dan is a smart man and the bacon was indeed extremely delicous. You can find the recipe at [baconmethod.com](http://baconmethod.com) and enjoy some yourself.[[1]](1) ![Photo](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-dg-deZjDhY4/UG8kNR-zVJI/AAAAAAAAACM/FyPK_yIfM5k/w296-h222-n-k/IMG_3888.JPG)
