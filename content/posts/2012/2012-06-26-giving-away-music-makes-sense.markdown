A really good take on [the state of the music business](http://derekwebb.tumblr.com/post/13503899950/giving-it-away-how-free-music-makes-more-than-sense) as it relates to Spotify, piracy, iTunes, and money from Derek Webb.


> I’ll go even further to say that I actually prefer illegal downloading over Spotify because when you get music illegally it’s at least implicit in the transaction that what you’re doing is potentially harmful to the artist.  But with Spotify, [your conscience is clear](http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_19361137) because you’re either enduring ads or paying to use the service and access the music.  But from the blue-collar artist’s perspective, they’re not receiving any meaningful payment (there’s [little discernible difference](http://matthewebel.com/2011/07/20/spotify-let-the-money-pour-in/) between $0.00029 and $0.00) and they are learning nothing about their fans, not to mention that music readily available on Spotify for little to no payment [completely poaches the record sales](http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2011/11/distributor-pulls-234-labels-from-spotify-napster-rdio-after-itunes-payments-drop-24.html) upon which middle-class musicians are depending for survival (which is why I will withhold any new releases from Spotify in the future).
