title: I Switched to Bing on my iPhone and I kind of liked it

I too have been fiddling around with Bing for the past few weeks and have found it surprisingly good experience.  The results seem just as good as Google's and they look a lot more attractive and clutter free on the iPhone.  Though oddly enough the desktop results seem a lot more cluttered on Bing than Google.
