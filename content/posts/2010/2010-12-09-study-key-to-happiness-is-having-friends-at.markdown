I don't find the results of this study very surprising.  The times in my life where I have been most contented have been when I am plugged in with a group of people who all have each other's backs.  I think Jesus traveled with a small group of guys who were close to him for this very reason.  He was modeling community at its smallest level.

It's not always easy to find time for others with the busyness of life, but it is vital.  Tif and I have made a point of being more intentional about relationships and building ourselves into the community at our church and I think it's safe to say that we have both been happier because of it.

2022 Edit:

A lot has changed in my life since writing this, not the least of which leaving my religous beliefs behind. That doesn't change the fact that
a strong community of friends has been a key part of my happiness through many stages of life.
