title: Update on iCloud+ Custom Email Domain
---

I've been using my custom domain with iCloud email for a couple weeks. Truth be
told I hardly notice any difference from when I used Gmail. That's largely due
to using Apple Mail app as my primary interface. I haven't had any reliability
issues and the only real difference I've noticed is the email size limit is
20MB as opposed to Gmail's 25MB. The primary benefit I've seen is that
calendar invites end up on my iCloud calendar, which is where I prefer them.

Your mileage may vary, but its working out for me thus far.
